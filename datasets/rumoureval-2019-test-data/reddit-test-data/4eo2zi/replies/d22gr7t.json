{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit": "DebunkThis", "likes": null, "created_utc": 1460636359.0, "score": 7, "user_reports": [], "body": "I can't believe people are missing the two obvious flaws in this analysis. This infographic doesn't show that 6 companies control 90% of the media. It doesn't provide any basis for the 90% figure. That's just a number pulled out of the air. All it shows is that 6 companies create and/or distribute a lot of media content. \n\nThere are other problems, too. I will update this when I get a few minutes to expand on it. \n\nEDIT: Ok, let's explore why this graphic is partly true, partly false and partly misleading. This isn't a comprehensive examination, just a look at some problems that stood out to me.\n\n&gt; *\u201cMedia has never been more consolidated. 6 media giants now control a staggering 90% of what we read, watch or listen to.\u201d*\n\nThe most fundamental problem is here. They give the numerator (the 6 media giants and the media they create or distribute), but never give the denominator (the total amount of media Americans consume). In fact, the infographic seems to suggest that it is basically just comparing ownership of the largest media outlets in 1983 to ownership of those same outlets today....as if media consumption today is, apart from ownership, the same as it was in 1983.  \n\n*&gt; \"232 Media executives control the information diet of 277 million Americans\"*\n\nWhere do these numbers come from?  How does he arrive at 232 media executives? What constitutes \"executive\" or \"control\" or an executive with control? The infographic does not explain. These are just numbers thrown out without any context or apparent methodology. \n\n\nThe infographic says the Comcast/NBC merger guarantees \"monopoly of 11 US markets like NYC and Chicago.\" I have no idea what that is even supposed to mean. Comcast is not the only provider in NYC or Chicago, and NBCUniversal was not the only cable channel/content producer/network, so in what sense did the merger create a \"monopoly\" in 11 markets?  \n\n*&gt; \"In 1995, the FCC forbade companies ownership of more than 40 stations. Clear Channel Communications now owns over 1,500.\"*\n\nIn 1996, Congress updated the Communications Act and eased ownership restrictions. As a result, some companies started buying a lot of radio stations. Many of those companies are now struggling to stay afloat, because radio audiences have cratered due to the rise of things like the iPod, satellite radio and the Internet. \n\nBut, you argue, maybe radio would be doing better if it was still locally owned instead of owned by big chains. That's a valid hypothesis. Unfortunately, locally owned and operated radio stations are not doing particularly well, either. The entire industry is struggling. The ability to achieve economies of scale has helped many radio stations that would otherwise be even further underwater. This benefit, however, is balanced against the tremendous debt burden that ClearChannel and other big companies took on when buying up stations.\n\nIn any event, \"80% of stations' playlists match\" because people are mostly the same everywhere. As exotic as those yankees/southerners/west coasters/midwesterners/people from Florida may seem to us, folks in other parts of the United States really aren't *all* that different.  Well, maybe people from Florida are, but the rest of us are pretty similar. There are some differences, which is why some areas have more country/rap/alternative/jazz/classical stations than others, but people who like classic rock mostly like the same bands and songs. People who like top 40 mostly like the same bands and songs.  \n\nRadio stations do extensive audience testing to determine their playlists, to measure what songs are getting \"burned\" and what songs audiences like (or might like). There are some regional differences, but people mostly like the same things. People in radio often hear outsiders who are certain they know what the station should do differently -- more new music, more variety, whatever -- and, frankly, many radio people would prefer their stations had more variety and were more inventive. But you know what? They also realize that what people say they want and what people *actually listen to* are two pretty different things. If \"more new music/more variety\" worked consistently, radio stations would do that, because money. \n\n*&gt; \"The Big Six's box office sales hit $7 billion in 2010, that's 2X the box office sales of the next 140 Studios*\"\n\nWait, earlier the infographic were talking about how a few media giants \"control\" the media by owning everything.  But this is a different claim. This claims that the few media giants are just *more successful* than \"the next 140 studios\". If there are 146 studios, then it sounds like there's a lot of competition to produce content and people just prefer the content produced by the \"Big 6\"....or, in reality, produced by one of many, many other studios and bought by the \"Big 6\" for distribution. \n\nAnd finally, the infographic closes with this dire warning: \"Until regulations return (or they buy each other out of existence), they will continue to control 90% of everything Americans see, hear and consider important.\"\n\nSounds serious, right? Now consider what some of the \"media consolidation\" Pollyanna's [were saying 15 years ago](https://transition.fcc.gov/ownership/roundtable_docs/cooper-a.pdf). \n\n&gt; \"The Internet has not yet evolved into a ubiquitous mass communications medium that can challenge the other media.\"\n\nYeah? How are those radio stations, newspapers and magazines holding up these days? \n\n&gt; \"The increasing concentration of the Internet is stunning. AOL's dominance of subscribership in the U.S. is widely noted ... Even more striking is the growth in the concentration of usage. Because the number of potential online channels is infinite, some assume that market dominance is an impossibility on the Internet. This is faulty reasoning. ... Analysis of Media Metrix data over the past three years shows an incontrovertible trend toward online media consolidation\u2026. Between March 1999 and March 2001, the total number of companies controlling 50 percent of user minutes online decreased by nearly two-thirds, from 11 to four. Because AOL has such a dominant position (over 30 percent of user time) the HHI is about 1200, well above the moderately concentrated threshold. The four firm concentration ratio also falls in the range where concerns about concentration and the abuse of market power begin. \n\nYes, 15 years ago they were Deeply Concerned that a few companies, mainly AOL, would \"control\" online media.  Shortly thereafter, AOL collapsed, Google and Facebook rose and every asshole with a Twitter account became their own media provider. \n\nThere are big media companies. There always have been.
