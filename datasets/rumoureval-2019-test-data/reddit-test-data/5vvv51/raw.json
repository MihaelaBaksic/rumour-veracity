Even those programs still purport to be &amp;quot;news&amp;quot; they are clearly opinion based programs no different from talk radio and it is not their problem if their viewers don&amp;#39;t look to see what programs are opinion based and whats news.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Even on Fox News own term of use it states the information on its website is used for the viewers enjoyment and entertainment. And Ailes the former CEO had even stated in an interview that he did not view CNN and NBC as competitors but ESPN and TNT. Doesnt prove anything but interesting to compare yourself to entertainment networks and still claim to be a news network. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now your co worker is wrong to say fox news is classified as entertainment as they do actually have a news program, (although them sharing one side of the story is a whole different debate) however their most popular programs like bill o&amp;#39;riley and sean hannity  are where the majority of their views and &amp;quot;news come from. In that case then the news most of thier views are getting can be classified as entertainment and can be extreamly misleading.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit_type": "public", "can_gild": true, "subreddit": "DebunkThis", "name": "t1_dfw69jf", "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/DebunkThis/comments/5vvv51/debunk_this_fox_news_is_classified_as/dfw69jf/", "num_reports": null, "stickied": false, "created": 1491475674.0, "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": 1491446874.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/DebunkThis", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "mod_note": null, "distinguished": null}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2rrbr", "approved_at_utc": null, "ups": 4, "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_5vvv51", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "no_follow": true, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "de5vb5a", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "wofo", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_5vvv51", "score": 4, "approved_by": null, "downs": 0, "body": "I had erroneously assumed that on Debunk This people would use sources.", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "collapsed": false, "is_submitter": true, "collapsed_reason": null, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I had erroneously assumed that on Debunk This people would use sources.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit_type": "public", "can_gild": true, "subreddit": "DebunkThis", "name": "t1_de5vb5a", "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/DebunkThis/comments/5vvv51/debunk_this_fox_news_is_classified_as/de5vb5a/", "num_reports": null, "stickied": false, "created": 1487984078.0, "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": 1487955278.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/DebunkThis", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "mod_note": null, "distinguished": null}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2rrbr", "approved_at_utc": null, "ups": 2, "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_5vvv51", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "no_follow": true, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "dist": null, "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2rrbr", "approved_at_utc": null, "ups": 2, "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_5vvv51", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "no_follow": true, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "de5nly3", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "DiogenesLied", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_de5j6c7", "score": 2, "approved_by": null, "downs": 0, "body": "Not in the US, but as u/Wolfsburg mentioned, [Canada](http://www.yesmagazine.org/people-power/a-law-against-lying-on-the-news) has such a law.", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "collapsed": false, "is_submitter": false, "collapsed_reason": null, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not in the US, but as &lt;a href=\"/u/Wolfsburg\"&gt;u/Wolfsburg&lt;/a&gt;
