An organism has to die in quite specific circumstances in order to end up as a fossil, and the vast majority of plants and animals will just decay into nothing. It's only because of the sheer age of the world and the number of organisms that have lived and died that we are able to find so many fossils.

Any organism discovered which is sufficiently different from other known organisms gets classified as a new species. If we know about Species A and Species C, and we believe Species C to be a descendant of Species A, then we might look for a species which is an ancestor of Species C *and* a descendant of Species A, which we'll call Species B. B would be a \"transitional form\" between A and C.
