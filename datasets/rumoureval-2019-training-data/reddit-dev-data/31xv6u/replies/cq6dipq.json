The main way scientists can date fossils they find is by referring to the [geological strata](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stratum) in which the fossils were found. The only working explanation for the existence of strata is that they were laid down over millions of years (before Darwin, it was actually geologists who first questioned the age of the Earth and the biblical creation myth.) By looking at which stratum a fossil was found in, you can get an idea, to the nearest million years or so, when the fossil was formed.\n\nYou can also use radioactive decay to date certain types of rock found in the same stratum. Carbon dating isn't much good for dinosaur fossils, as it can only date objects younger than about 50,000 years, but by looking at the decay of elements with longer half-lives like uranium, you can determine when certain (volcanic) strata were laid down. If you find a fossil above a stratum you know is 80 million years old, and below a stratum you know is 60 million years old, that fossil must be between 60 and 80 million years old.\n\nhttp://evolution.berkeley.edu/evosite/lines/IIIAchronology.shtml", "author": "mishagale", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "mod_note": null, "mod_reason_by": null, "depth": 0, "author_flair_template_id": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;However, scientists do not dig up anything labeled with those ages.
