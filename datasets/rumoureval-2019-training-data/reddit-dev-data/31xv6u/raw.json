Consider the following train of thought:\n\n1) There are a hell of a lot of people involved in the sciences. Everything from medical research to physics to geology to orbital mechanics to engineering and materials, etc.\n\n2) A subset of these people are involved in Paleontology, but relevantly their work _overlaps_ with these other sciences. Radiometric dating overlaps with nuclear physics. Strata dating overlaps with geology. Our understanding of fossilisation comes from our understandings of chemistry and biology.\n\n3) All of these other disciplines are tested by the fact that we _use_ them. We use geology to find oils and minerals and predict the weather and choose where to build huge buildings. We use biology and chemistry in a huge range of applications, from chemical engineering to antibiotics to heart transplants to modern crop farming. We have nuclear reactors that have been churning out predicable power for decades, and satellites serving our communications, and millions of aeroplanes safely running about the skies. We have cellphones.\n\n4) All of the above are using exactly the same understandings about the world that paleontologists use to date dinosaur bones and evolutionary scientists use to understand the development of modern species. It's all the same mechanics, just a slightly different application. To say that the knowledge is somehow wrong is like saying that a man who is an excellent driver of a four-door sedan can in no way know _anything_ about driving a hatchback.\n\nSo, this leads us to one of three conclusions. Either...\n\na) We're somehow wrong about how everything works, and all the stuff we've managed to do is sheer luck that it works, despite our misunderstanding.\n\nb) It's all a giant 'evolutionist' conspiracy, one that would have to involve so many people that it would be almost a majority of the population (at least, the population with power and influence). The point of such a conspiracy would be unclear, since I can't see a real reward.\n\nc) The bible literalists are wrong.\n\nPersonally, I'm leaning towards 'c' as the most likely answer.", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "collapsed": false, "is_submitter": false, "collapsed_reason": null, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The others have given good answers, and I would like to add &lt;a href=\"http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Answers_in_Genesis\"&gt;http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Answers_in_Genesis&lt;/a&gt; to the mix.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But over and above that, a little rational thought might be an interesting place to work from. Consider the following train of thought:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;1) There are a hell of a lot of people involved in the sciences. Everything from medical research to physics to geology to orbital mechanics to engineering and materials, etc.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;2) A subset of these people are involved in Paleontology, but relevantly their work &lt;em&gt;overlaps&lt;/em&gt; with these other sciences. Radiometric dating overlaps with nuclear physics. Strata dating overlaps with geology. Our understanding of fossilisation comes from our understandings of chemistry and biology.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;3) All of these other disciplines are tested by the fact that we &lt;em&gt;use&lt;/em&gt; them. We use geology to find oils and minerals and predict the weather and choose where to build huge buildings. We use biology and chemistry in a huge range of applications, from chemical engineering to antibiotics to heart transplants to modern crop farming. We have nuclear reactors that have been churning out predicable power for decades, and satellites serving our communications, and millions of aeroplanes safely running about the skies. We have cellphones.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;4) All of the above are using exactly the same understandings about the world that paleontologists use to date dinosaur bones and evolutionary scientists use to understand the development of modern species. It&amp;#39;s all the same mechanics, just a slightly different application. To say that the knowledge is somehow wrong is like saying that a man who is an excellent driver of a four-door sedan can in no way know &lt;em&gt;anything&lt;/em&gt; about driving a hatchback.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, this leads us to one of three conclusions. Either...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;a) We&amp;#39;re somehow wrong about how everything works, and all the stuff we&amp;#39;ve managed to do is sheer luck that it works, despite our misunderstanding.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;b) It&amp;#39;s all a giant &amp;#39;evolutionist&amp;#39; conspiracy, one that would have to involve so many people that it would be almost a majority of the population (at least, the population with power and influence). The point of such a conspiracy would be unclear, since I can&amp;#39;t see a real reward.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;c) The bible literalists are wrong.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Personally, I&amp;#39;m leaning towards &amp;#39;c&amp;#39; as the most likely answer.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit_type": "public", "can_gild": true, "subreddit": "DebunkThis", "name": "t1_cq6fj7f", "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/DebunkThis/comments/31xv6u/serious_man_and_dinosaurs_lived_at_the_same_time/cq6fj7f/", "num_reports": null, "stickied": false, "created": 1428609161.0, "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": 1428580361.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/DebunkThis", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "mod_note": null, "distinguished": null}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2rrbr", "approved_at_utc": null, "ups": 6, "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_31xv6u", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "no_follow": true, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "cq6dipq", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "mishagale", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_31xv6u", "score": 6, "approved_by": null, "downs": 0, "body": "&gt;However, scientists do not dig up anything labeled with those ages.
