You have neo-nazis running for office in the conservative party (GOP, illinois, california, minnesota/michigan). The current GOP platform gives a voice to these types of hate and extreme views, call your rep, ask to denounce them at least, put some fucking effort in.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Reports published by the CIS have been widely deemed misleading and riddled with basic errors by scholars on immigration; think tanks from across the ideological and political spectrum; media of all stripes; several leading nonpartisan immigration-research organizations; and by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Most people agree with the sentiment by the sounds of it. I disagree with your assessment on sam harris (borderline religious lunatic was my first impression), pinker keeps railing on about &amp;#39;enlighenment&amp;#39; and comes across as Pompous twat with his head up his own arse, he may be a psychologist and a harvard graduate but he rants about nothing like a motherfucker.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b09rwszj\"&gt;https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b09rwszj&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/nov/28/alt-right-online-poison-racist-bigot-sam-harris-milo-yiannopoulos-islamophobia\"&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/nov/28/alt-right-online-poison-racist-bigot-sam-harris-milo-yiannopoulos-islamophobia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regressive_left\"&gt;https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regressive_left&lt;/a&gt;
