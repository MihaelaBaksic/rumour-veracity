The whole \"fake news\" for reporting what he said thing, saying \"We left [the Nato] meeting more unified and wealthier as a group than ever before\" - interesting use of \"wealthy\" there.\n\nOn meeting with President Putin:\n\n&gt; We will talk about a number of things: Ukraine, Syria, the Middle East, nuclear proliferation. We are massively modernizing and fixing and buying and it\u2019s just a devastating technology. It is a very bad policy. We have no choice. We are massively big and they are very big and I\u2019ll be talking about nuclear proliferation.\n\nOn Nato spending:\n\n&gt; I say we pay 90 percent of the cost of NATO, which is really there for Europe much more than for us.\n\nHe can say that, but it isn't true. Based on [a couple](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/jul/12/donald-trump/donald-trump-misleads-us-defense-spending-nato-bud/) of [sources](https://www.nato.int/cps/ie/natohq/topics_67655.htm) the US contributes 22% of Nato's common fund, and about 70% of Nato military spending.\n\nOn immigration, after some classic dog-whistle racism:\n\n&gt;  It\u2019s not good for Europe and it\u2019s not good for our country. We have very bad immigration laws. We\u2019re doing incredibly well considering we virtually don\u2019t have immigration laws \u2014 I don\u2019t even call them laws, you just walk across the border and then you\u2019re tied in a lawsuit for five years.\n\nOn the UK-US special relationship:\n\n&gt; I would give our relationship with the U.K. the highest level of special. Am I allowed to go higher than that? They are very special people, it\u2019s a very special country and my mother was born in Scotland. As far as advice goes, I gave her a suggestion and I think maybe she found it too brutal. I gave her a suggestion, not advice. I can fully understand why she thought it might be tough \u2014 if they don\u2019t get the right deal, she may choose to do what I suggested. It\u2019s a disgrace how the EU has taken advantage of the U.S.\n\nOn Russia invading Ukraine:\n\n&gt; President Obama failed very badly with Crimea \u2014 I wouldn\u2019t have done that. He took it over during the Obama administration. We\u2019ll have to see what happens ... I\u2019m not bad at doing things. Let\u2019s see what happens. This was an Obama disaster. If I were president, he would not have taken over.\n\nOn Theresa May:\n\n&gt;  She will do very well. She is a tough negotiator and a very smart and determined people.\n\nOn the Russia meeting:\n\n&gt; Proliferation, to me, is the biggest problem in the world. I understand nuclear. I used to talk nuclear with my uncle. It is the biggest problem the world has, so if we can do something to reduce them, maybe it\u2019s a dream, but it\u2019s a subject I will bring up with him. I was telling the PM that I\u2019m not going in with high expectations. We have stupidity going on in the U.S. that makes it hard to do something with Russia.
