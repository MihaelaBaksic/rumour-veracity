The way these molecules trap heat is easy: they absorb the radiation, keep it then radiate it out in all directions. Other molecules then pick up this radiated heat and the cycles continues.\n\nThe way this becomes a problem is due to positive feedback, which is a way of saying \"something causes itself\". Heating the atmosphere has another effect, heating up air allows for it to absorb more water vapour and since water vapour is a GHG, yeah you're seeing where this is going. The warmer the atmosphere gets, the more GHG's it can absorb and so on.\n\nNow where deniers get this wrong is the whole state of the CO2. Yes plants and trees absorb CO2, the issue is that this cycle (aptly named the Carbon Cycle) was in equalibium, the amount of CO2 entering the atmosphere was equal to the amount leaving. Now it is not equal, the amount entering the atmosphere is far more than the total biomass can absorb and thus a net increase.\n\nI hope this clears up certain myths because the science of climate change is really not difficult to understand.\n\n(I'm a student in my 3rd year of environmental science with year 1 being mostly CC so AMA I guess?)
