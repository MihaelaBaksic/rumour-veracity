person).\n\nThere's also the fundamental role that it plays in \"fire and maneuver\" tactics.  One group of soldiers, firing from cover, works to get as much lead flying in the general direction of the opposition in an attempt to hinder their ability to fire on another group of their comrades that are relocating elsewhere.  It's basically meant to be psychological, discouraging the enemy from doing anything more active than taking cover.
