You can then play around with what the results would look like in different hypothetical turnout scenarios.\n\nI considered three situations:\n\na) actual - as shown above;\n\nb) everyone votes - every eligible person at every age group votes; and\n\nc) everyone under 35 votes - The most optimistic scenario for Labour, every person under 35 votes and turnout at other ages remains as it actually was.\n\nThe results are shown below,\n\nParty | Actual | Everyone votes | All u35 vote\n---|---:|----:|----:\nCon|36.4%|35.7%|35.3%\nLab|30.7%|31.8%|32.2%\nLD|7.9%|7.8%|7.6%\nUKIP|12.6%|12.2%|12.0%\nGreen|6.9%|6.9%|7.0%\nOth |5.4%|5.7%|5.9%\n\nSo in short while the gap would close, even in the most optimistic scenario for Labour, the Tories would have still won the popular vote. The other surprising result from this was how little the green party benefit from increased young turnout, I expected them to show the biggest difference but it seems that their support is actually broadly even across the age range.\n\nCaveats:\n\nThis is a very simple and rough model, it doesn't say anything about constituencies or seats. In actual fact the impact in a few key swing seats could have the power to change which party was actually elected. \n\nIn addition it is based on post election surveying which will not exactly represent the actual results and the no. of voters is based on census information which will include people not eligible to vote. \n\n[Edit to add] Another issue is the implicit assumption that non voters would divide up between the parties in the same way that voters do. This would probably be fine to assume if 100% of non-voters didn't vote because they couldn't be bothered or didn't care. However presumably some proportion of non-voters are in that group because they don't feel that there is a party which represents their views.
