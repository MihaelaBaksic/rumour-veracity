==Background==
The attack came a day after an incident in [[Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu]], [[Quebec]] involving Martin Couture-Rouleau, an Islamic convert and sympathiser of the [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant|ISIL]] movement with extensive police encounters. Rouleau used his car to [[hit and run]] two Canadian Forces soldiers, injuring one fatally, before being himself fatally shot after a car chase. Canada raised its terror threat level from low to medium. It is not confirmed if the shootings are related to this incident and if the terror threat level will be raised even further.<ref name="BBC News">{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-29724907?ns_mchannel=social&ns_campaign=bbc_breaking&ns_source=twitter&ns_linkname=news_central|title=Shots fired inside Canada parliament|work=BBC News|accessdate=October 22, 2014}}</ref>-->
