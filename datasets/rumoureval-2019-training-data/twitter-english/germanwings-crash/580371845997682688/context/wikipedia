French President [[François Hollande]] made a statement saying: "The conditions of the accident, which have not yet been clarified, lead us to think there are no survivors."<ref>[http://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/25/world/europe/germanwings-crash.html?hp&action=click&pgtype=Homepage&module=first-column-region&region=top-news&WT.nav=top-news Germanwings Flight Carrying 148 Crashes in Southern France].

[[King Felipe VI]] of Spain, who was in [[Paris]] on a [[state visit]] to France at the time of the crash, announced his decision to cut short the state visit and return to Spain.
