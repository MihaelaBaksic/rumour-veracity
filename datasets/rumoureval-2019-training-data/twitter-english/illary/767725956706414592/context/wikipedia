'''Hillary Diane Rodham Clinton''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|h|ɪ|l|ə|r|i|_|d|aɪ|ˈ|æ|n|_|ˈ|r|ɒ|d|ə|m|_|ˈ|k|l|ɪ|n|t|ən}}; born October 26, 1947) is an American politician and the nominee of the [[2016 Democratic National Convention|Democratic Party]] for [[President of the United States]] in the [[United States presidential election, 2016|2016 election]]. She served as the [[List of Secretaries of State of the United States|67th]] [[United States Secretary of State]] from 2009 to 2013, the junior [[United States Senator]] representing New York from 2001 to 2009, [[First Lady of the United States]] during the presidency of [[Bill Clinton]] from 1993 to 2001, and First Lady of Arkansas during his governorship from 1979 to 1981 and from 1983 to 1992.

Born in Chicago and raised in the suburb of [[Park Ridge, Illinois]], Clinton attended [[Wellesley College]], graduating in 1969, and earned a [[Juris Doctor|J.D.]] from [[Yale Law School]] in 1973. After serving as a [[United States Congress|congressional]] legal counsel, she moved to Arkansas, marrying Bill Clinton in 1975. In 1977, she co-founded [[Arkansas Advocates for Children and Families]]. She was appointed the first female chair of the [[Legal Services Corporation]] in 1978, and, the following year, became the first woman partner at [[Rose Law Firm]]. As First Lady of Arkansas (1979–81, 1983–92), she led a task force whose recommendations helped reform Arkansas's public schools, and served on several [[Board of directors#Corporations|corporate boards]].

As First Lady of the United States, Clinton led the unsuccessful effort to enact the [[Clinton health care plan of 1993]]. In 1997 and 1999, she helped create the [[State Children's Health Insurance Program]]. She also tackled the problems of [[Adoption and Safe Families Act|adoption and family safety]] and [[Foster Care Independence Act|foster care]]. At the [[Fourth World Conference on Women|1995 UN conference on women]], held in Beijing, Clinton stated in a then controversial and [[Women's Rights Are Human Rights|influential speech]], that "human rights are women's rights and women's rights are human rights". Her marriage endured the [[Lewinsky scandal]] of 1998, and her role as first lady drew a [[Polarization (politics)|polarized]] response from the public.

Clinton [[United States Senate election in New York, 2000|was elected in 2000]] as the first female [[List of United States Senators from New York|senator from New York]], the only first lady ever to have sought elective office. Following the [[September 11 attacks]], she voted to approve the [[War in Afghanistan (2001–14)|war in Afghanistan]]. She also voted for the [[Iraq Resolution]], which she later regretted. She took a leading role in investigating the [[Health effects arising from the September 11 attacks|health issues faced by 9/11 first responders]]. She voted against the [[Bush tax cuts]]. She was [[United States Senate election in New York, 2006|re-elected to the Senate in 2006]]. Running for president in 2008, [[Hillary Clinton presidential campaign, 2008|she won far more delegates]] than any previous female candidate, but lost the [[Democratic Party presidential primaries, 2008|Democratic nomination]] to Illinois Senator [[Barack Obama]].

<!--Intentionally using a fifth paragraph-->As Secretary of State in the Obama administration from 2009 to 2013, Clinton responded to the [[Arab Spring]], during which [[War Powers Resolution#Libya intervention in 2011|she advocated]] the [[2011 military intervention in Libya|U.S. military intervention in Libya]]. She helped organize a diplomatic isolation and international sanctions regime against Iran, in an effort to force curtailment of [[Nuclear program of Iran|that country's nuclear program]]; this would eventually lead to the multinational [[Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action]] agreement in 2015. Leaving office after Obama's first term, she wrote her fifth book and undertook speaking engagements before announcing her second presidential run in the [[United States presidential election, 2016|2016 election]].

Clinton received the most votes and primary delegates in the [[Democratic primaries 2016|2016 Democratic primaries]], formally accepting her party's nomination for President of the United States on July 28, 2016, with [[Vice President of the United States|vice presidential]] [[running mate]], Senator [[Tim Kaine]]. She became the first female candidate to be nominated for president by a major [[U.S. political party]]. As part of her 2016 platform, she has emphasized raising incomes, improvements to the&nbsp;[[Affordable Care Act]] and reform of [[Campaign finance reform in the United States|campaign finance]] and  [[Wall Street reform|Wall Street]]. She favors allowing pathways to citizenship for undocumented immigrants, expanding and protecting [[LGBT rights in the United States|LGBT]] and [[women's rights]], and instituting family support through [[Parental leave|paid parental leave]] and [[universal preschool]].

==Early life and education==

===Early life===
Hillary{{efn|In 1995, Hillary Clinton said her mother had named her after [[Edmund Hillary|Sir Edmund Hillary]], co-first mountaineer to scale [[Mount Everest]], and that was the reason for the less-common "two L's" spelling of her name. However, the Everest climb did not take place until 1953, more than five years after she was born. In October 2006, a Clinton spokeswoman said she was not named after the mountain climber. Instead, this account of her name's origin "was a sweet family story her mother shared to inspire greatness in her daughter, to great results I might add."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.snopes.com/politics/clintons/hillary.asp |title=Hillary vs. Hillary |publisher=Snopes.com |date=October 26, 2006}}</ref>}} Diane Rodham was born on October 26, 1947, at Edgewater Hospital in Chicago, Illinois.<ref name="Whitehouse.gov"/><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.edgewaterhistory.org/ehs/articles/v14-3-4 |title=Edgewater Hospital 1929–2001 |author=O'Laughlin, Dania |publisher=Edgewater Historical Society |date=Summer 2003 |accessdate=June 10, 2007 }}</ref> She was raised in a [[United Methodist]] family, first in Chicago and then, from the age of three, in suburban [[Park Ridge, Illinois]].{{sfn|Bernstein|2007|pp=18, 34}} Her father, [[Hugh E.

===From the East Coast to Arkansas===
During her postgraduate study, Rodham served as staff attorney for Edelman's newly founded [[Children's Defense Fund]] in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]],{{sfn|Bernstein|2007|pp=91–92}} and as a consultant to the Carnegie Council on Children.<ref>Brock 1996, p.&nbsp;42</ref> In 1974 she was a member of the impeachment inquiry staff in Washington, D.C., advising the [[United States House Committee on the Judiciary|House Committee on the Judiciary]] during the [[Watergate scandal]].{{sfn|Bernstein|2007|pp=94–96, 101–03}} Under the guidance of Chief Counsel [[John Doar]] and senior member [[Bernard W.

By then, Rodham was viewed as someone with a bright political future: Democratic political organizer and consultant [[Betsey Wright]] had moved from Texas to Washington the previous year to help guide Rodham's career.{{sfn|Bernstein|2007|p=62}} Wright thought she had the potential to become a future senator or president.{{sfn|Maraniss|1995|p=277}} Meanwhile, boyfriend Bill Clinton had repeatedly asked Rodham to marry him and she continued to demur.{{sfn|Bernstein|2007|pp=90, 120}} After failing the [[District of Columbia]] [[Multistate Performance Test|bar exam]]<ref>Bernstein 2007, p.&nbsp;92; Allen and Parnes 2014, p.&nbsp;149. Taking an out-of-date bar study class may have been a factor. Two-thirds (551 of 817) of the candidates passed, and Rodham did not tell even close friends of the failure until revealing it thirty years later in her autobiography</ref> and passing the Arkansas exam, Rodham came to a key decision. As she later wrote, "I chose to follow my heart instead of my head".<ref>Clinton 2003, p.&nbsp;69</ref> She thus followed Clinton to Arkansas, rather than staying in Washington, where career prospects were brighter. He was then teaching law and running for a seat in the [[U.S. House of Representatives]] in his home state. In August 1974, Rodham moved to [[Fayetteville, Arkansas]], and became one of only two female faculty members in the [[University of Arkansas School of Law|School of Law]] at the [[University of Arkansas, Fayetteville]].{{sfn|Bernstein|2007|p=92}}<ref>Clinton 2003, p.&nbsp;70.

Hillary Clinton received sustained national attention for the first time when her husband became a candidate for the [[Democratic Party presidential primaries, 1992|Democratic presidential nomination of 1992]].

First Lady Clinton was a subject of several investigations by the [[United States Office of the Independent Counsel]], committees of the U.S. Congress, and the press.

Scrutiny of the May 1993 firings of the White House Travel Office employees, an affair that became known as "[[White House travel office controversy|Travelgate]]", began with charges that the White House had used audited financial irregularities in the Travel Office operation as an excuse to replace the staff with friends from Arkansas.{{sfn|Bernstein|2007|pp=327–28}} The 1996 discovery of a two-year-old White House memo caused the investigation to focus on whether Clinton had orchestrated the firings and whether the statements she made to investigators about her role in the firings were true.{{sfn|Bernstein|2007|pp=439–44}}<ref>{{Cite news |author=Johnson, David |title=Memo Places Hillary Clinton At Core of Travel Office Case|work=The New York Times|date=January 5, 1996 |url=http://www.nytimes.com/1996/01/05/us/memo-places-hillary-clinton-at-core-of-travel-office-case.html }}</ref> The 2000 final Independent Counsel report concluded she was involved in the firings and that she had made "factually false" statements, but that there was insufficient evidence that she knew the statements were false, or knew that her actions would lead to firings, to prosecute her.<ref>{{Cite news |author=Hughes, Jane |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/802335.stm |title=Hillary escapes 'Travelgate' charges |publisher=BBC News |date=June 23, 2000}}</ref>

===Response to Lewinsky scandal===
{{Further information|Lewinsky scandal}}
In 1998, the Clintons' relationship became the subject of much speculation when investigations revealed that the President had engaged in an extramarital affair with White House intern [[Monica Lewinsky]].<ref>Troy 2006, pp.&nbsp;176–77</ref> Events surrounding the [[Lewinsky scandal]] eventually led to the [[Impeachment of Bill Clinton]] by the House of Representatives and later acquittal by the Senate.

She later said that she had been misled by her husband's initial claims that no affair had taken place.<ref>Troy 2006, p.&nbsp;187</ref> After the evidence of President Clinton's encounters with Lewinsky became incontrovertible, she issued a public statement reaffirming her commitment to their marriage, but privately was reported to be furious at him and was unsure if she wanted to stay in the marriage.{{sfn|Bernstein|2007|pp=512, 517–18, 521}} The White House residence staff noticed a pronounced level of tension between the couple during this period.<ref>Brower 2015, pp. 141–49</ref>

Public reaction varied. Some women admired her strength and poise in private matters made public, some sympathized with her as a victim of her husband's insensitive behavior, others criticized her as being an [[Codependency|enabler]] to her husband's indiscretions, while still others accused her of cynically staying in a failed marriage as a way of keeping or even fostering her own political influence.{{sfn|Gerth|Van Natta|2007|p=195}} Her public approval ratings in the wake of the revelations shot upward to around 70&nbsp;percent, the highest they had ever been.{{sfn|Gerth|Van Natta|2007|p=195}} In her 2003 memoir, she would attribute her decision to stay married to "a love that has persisted for decades" and add: "No one understands me better and no one can make me laugh the way Bill does. Even after all these years, he is still the most interesting, energizing and fully alive person I have ever met."<ref>Clinton 2003, p.&nbsp;75</ref>

Matters surrounding the Lewinsky scandal left Bill Clinton with substantial legal bills; in 2014, Hillary Clinton would state that she and Bill had left the White House "not only dead broke, but in debt." The statement may have been literally accurate but ignored the potentially enormous earnings potential of presidents upon leaving office as well as the couple's ability to secure loans from banks.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/jun/10/hillary-clinton/hillary-clinton-says-she-and-bill-were-dead-broke/ |title=Hillary Clinton says she and Bill were 'dead broke' |author=Greenberg, Jon |publisher=PolitiFact.com |date=June 10, 2014}}</ref>

When New York's long-serving U.S. Senator [[Daniel Patrick Moynihan]] announced his retirement in November 1998, several prominent Democratic figures, including Representative [[Charles Rangel]] of New York, urged Clinton to run for Moynihan's open seat in the [[United States Senate elections, 2000|Senate election of 2000]].{{sfn|Bernstein|2007|p=530}} Once she decided to run, the Clintons purchased a home in [[Chappaqua, New York]], north of New York City, in September 1999.<ref>{{Cite news |author=Nagourney, Adam |url=http://www.nytimes.com/1999/09/03/nyregion/with-some-help-clintons-purchase-a-white-house.html |title=With Some Help, Clintons Purchase a White House |work=The New York Times |date=September 3, 1999 |authorlink=Adam Nagourney}}</ref> She became the first first lady of the United States to be a candidate for elected office.{{sfn|Gerth|Van Natta|2007|p=204}} Initially, Clinton expected to face [[Rudy Giuliani]], the [[Mayor of New York City]], as her Republican opponent in the election.

Throughout her time in office, and in her final speech concluding it, Clinton viewed "[[smart power]]" as the strategy for asserting U.S. leadership and values—in a world of varied threats, weakened central governments, and increasingly important nongovernmental entities—by combining military [[hard power]] with diplomacy and U.S. [[soft power]] capacities in global economics, development aid, technology, creativity, and human rights advocacy.<ref name="time-smart"/><ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/in-farewell-speech-clinton-calls-for-smart-power-on-global-stage/ |title=In farewell speech, Clinton calls for 'smart power' on global stage |author=Madison, Lucy |publisher=CBS News |date=January 31, 2013}}</ref> As such, she became the first secretary of state to methodically implement the smart power approach.<ref>Ghattas 2013, pp.&nbsp;11, 334</ref> In debates over use of military force, she was generally one of the more [[War hawk|hawkish]] voices in the administration.<ref name="landler-nytm"/><ref name="a-p-gates"/><ref name="time-crowley">{{cite news |url=http://swampland.time.com/2014/01/14/hillary-clintons-unapologetically-hawkish-record-faces-2016-test/ |title=Hillary Clinton's Unapologetically Hawkish Record Faces 2016 Test |author=Crowley, Michael |work=Time |date=January 14, 2014}}</ref> In August 2011 she hailed the ongoing multinational military intervention in Libya and the initial U.S. response towards the Syrian Civil War as examples of smart power in action.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/clinton-us-using-smart-power-for-libya-syria/ |title=Clinton: US using 'smart power' for Libya, Syria |publisher=CBS News |date=August 16, 2011}}</ref>

===Email controversy===
{{Main article|Hillary Clinton email controversy}}
A controversy arose in March 2015, when it was revealed by the State Department's inspector general that Clinton had exclusively used personal email accounts on a non-government, privately maintained server—in lieu of email accounts maintained on federal government servers—when conducting official business during her tenure as Secretary of State. Some experts, officials, members of Congress, and political opponents, contended that her use of private [[Message transfer agent|messaging system]] software and a private server violated State Department protocols and procedures, and federal laws and regulations governing [[Records management|recordkeeping requirements]]. The controversy occurred against the backdrop of Clinton's 2016 presidential election campaign and hearings held by the House Select Committee on Benghazi.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/04/us/politics/using-private-email-hillary-clinton-thwarted-record-requests.html |title=Using Private Email, Hillary Clinton Thwarted Record Requests |author=Schmidt, Michael S. |author2=Chozick, Amy |work=The New York Times |date=March 3, 2015}}</ref><ref name="wapo-email">{{cite news |url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/state-department-reviewing-whether-clinton-e-mail-violated-security-rules/2015/03/05/16d1547e-c378-11e4-9271-610273846239_story.html |title=Clinton email review could find security issues |author=Leonnig, Carol D. |author2=Helderman, Rosalind S. |author3=Gearan, Anne |newspaper=The Washington Post |date=March 6, 2015}}</ref>

Clinton maintained that she did not send or receive any confidential emails from her personal server at the time they were sent. In a Democratic debate with [[Bernie Sanders]] on February 4, 2016, Clinton said, "I never sent or received any classified material – they are retroactively classifying it."  On July 2, 2016, Clinton stated: "Let me repeat what I have repeated for many months now, I never received nor sent any material that was marked classified."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/fbi-investigation-sheds-light-hillary-clintons-past-email/story?id=40350589 |title=FBI Probe Contradicts Clinton's Claim She Never Sent Classified Emails |publisher=Abcnews.go.com |date=2016-07-05 |accessdate=2016-07-12}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Kessler |first=Glenn |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2015/08/27/clintons-claims-about-receiving-or-sending-classified-material-on-her-private-email-system/ |title=Clinton's claims about receiving or sending 'classified material' on her private e-mail system |publisher=The Washington Post |date=2015-08-27 |accessdate=2016-07-12}}</ref>

On July 5, 2016, the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] concluded its investigation. In a statement, FBI director [[James Comey]] said:

<blockquote>110 e-mails in 52 e-mail chains have been determined by the owning agency to contain classified information at the time they were sent or received. Eight of those chains contained information that was Top Secret at the time they were sent; 36 chains contained Secret information at the time; and eight contained Confidential information, which is the lowest level of classification. Separate from those, about 2,000 additional e-mails were "up-classified" to make them Confidential; the information in those had not been classified at the time the e-mails were sent.<ref name="fbi.gov">{{cite web|url=https://www.fbi.gov/news/pressrel/press-releases/statement-by-fbi-director-james-b.-comey-on-the-investigation-of-secretary-hillary-clintons-use-of-a-personal-e-mail-system |title=Statement by FBI Director James B.

Three emails, out of 30,000, were found to be marked as classified, although they lacked classified headers and were only marked with a small "c" in parentheses, described as "portion markings" by Comey. He also said it was possible Clinton was not "technically sophisticated" enough to understand what the three classified markings meant.<ref name="Kiely"/> The probe found that Clinton used her personal email extensively while outside the United States, both sending and receiving work-related emails in the territory of sophisticated adversaries. The FBI assessed that it "is possible that hostile actors gained access to Secretary Clinton's personal email account."<ref name="fbi.gov"/> Comey stated that although Clinton was "extremely careless in their handling of very sensitive, highly classified information", the FBI was expressing to the Justice Department that "no charges are appropriate in this case."<ref name="fbi.gov"/> On July 6, 2016, U.S. Attorney General [[Loretta Lynch]] confirmed that the probe into Clinton's use of private email servers while secretary of state will be closed without criminal charges.<ref>{{cite web|last=Zapotosky |first=Matt |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/justice-department-closes-clinton-email-probe-without-charges/2016/07/06/0ad8feda-43c2-11e6-88d0-6adee48be8bc_story.html |title=Justice Department closes Clinton email probe without charges |publisher=The Washington Post |date=2012-12-14 |accessdate=2016-07-12}}</ref>

Clinton has been a lifelong [[Methodist]], attending various churches throughout her lifetime; all belonging to the [[United Methodist Church]]:

* First United Methodist Church of [[Little Rock, Arkansas]] – while in Arkansas,
* Foundry United Methodist Church in [[Washington, D.C.]] – as First Lady of the United States,
* Metropolitan Community United Methodist Church in [[New York City, New York]] – currently a congregant.

She discussed her faith at 2014 United Methodist Women church rally at the Kentucky International Convention Center in [[Louisville, Kentucky]].<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtBePkrEr3w Hillary Rodham Clinton: Assembly 2014]</ref> However, she has infrequently discussed her faith while campaigning.<ref name="Faith">

In early 2016, a [[Pew Research Center|Pew]] poll was released finding that over 4 in 10 Americans believed Clinton was not very religious. As of 2016, Clinton has openly discussed her Christianity on several occasions, discussing for example the importance of loving one's neighbor as oneself, of helping the poor and "creating opportunities for others to be lifted up".<ref name="PersonalChrist"/> Clinton has also expressed disappointment that "Christianity, which has such great love at its core, is sometimes used to condemn so quickly and judge so harshly."<ref name="PersonalChrist"/>

Professor [[Paul Kengor]], author of ''God and Hillary Clinton: A Spiritual Life'', has suggested that Clinton's political positions are rooted in her faith. Clinton reportedly often repeats [[John Wesley]]'s apocryphal maxim "Do all the good you can, by all the means you can, in all the ways you can."<ref name="Faith"/> In fact, Clinton repeated this saying in her acceptance speech at the 2016 Democratic National Convention, adding that her mother Dorothy "made sure I learned [these] words from our Methodist faith."<ref>{{cite AV media | people = 2016 Democratic National Convention | title = Hillary Clinton Acceptance Speech | medium = video {quote is at 48 min. 56 sec.} | publisher = C-SPAN | date = July 28, 2016 | url = https://www.c-span.org/video/?412848-101/hillary-clinton-acceptance-speech}}</ref>
