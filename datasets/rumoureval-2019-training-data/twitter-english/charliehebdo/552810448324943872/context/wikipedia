==Background==
''Charlie Hebdo'' ({{IPA-fr|ʃaʁli ɛbdo}}; [[French language|French]] for ''Charlie Weekly'') is a French [[satirical]] weekly newspaper, featuring cartoons, reports, polemics and jokes. Irreverent and stridently non-conformist in tone, the publication is strongly [[antireligious]]<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.lemonde.fr/idees/article/2013/11/20/non-charlie-hebdo-n-est-pas-raciste_3516646_3232.html | title=Non, "Charlie Hebdo" n’est pas raciste ! | publisher=[[Le Monde]] | accessdate=4 March 2014 | author=Charb}}</ref> and [[Left-wing politics|left-wing]], publishing articles on the extreme right, Catholicism, Islam, Judaism, politics, culture, etc. According to its editor, Charb, the magazine's editorial viewpoint reflects "all components of left wing pluralism, and even abstainers".<ref>«Charlie Hebdo, c'est la gauche plurielle» [archive] sur lecourrier.ch du 9 avril 2010</ref>

It first appeared from 1969 to 1981; it folded, but was resurrected in 1992.  {{As of|2012}} the editor is Charb (Stephane Charbonnier). His predecessors are [[François Cavanna]] (1969–1981) and [[Philippe Val]] (1992–2009). The magazine is published every Wednesday, with special editions issued on an unscheduled basis.

===2011 firebombing===
The paper's controversial 3 November 2011 issue, renamed "[[Sharia|''Charia'']] ''Hebdo''" and "guest-edited" by [[Muhammad]], featured images of the Islamic prophet depicted saying: "100 lashes of the whip if you don't die laughing."<ref name="bbc-15550350">{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-15550350 |title=BBC News: Attack on French satirical paper Charlie Hebdo (November 2, 2011) |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date=2 November 2011 |accessdate=21 December 2011}}</ref>

In the early hours of 2 November 2011, the newspaper's office in the [[20th arrondissement of Paris|20th arrondissement]]<ref name=FT01>{{cite news |last=Boxel |first=James |url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/75f87b24-0541-11e1-a3d1-00144feabdc0.html |title=Firebomb attack on satirical French magazine |newspaper=Financial Times |date= 2 November 2011 <!-- 12:06 pm -->  |accessdate= 19 September 2012}}</ref> was fire-bombed and its website [[hacked]]. The attacks were presumed linked to the edition "Charia Hebdo" edition.<ref name="bbc-15550350">{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-15550350 |title=BBC News: Attack on French satirical paper Charlie Hebdo (November 2, 2011) |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date=2 November 2011 |accessdate=21 December 2011}}</ref> The cover, featuring a cartoon of Mohammed by Luz (Renald Luzier), had circulated on social media for a couple of days.

Charb was quoted by [[Associated Press|AP]] stating that the attack might have been carried out by "stupid people who don't know what Islam is" and that they are "idiots who betray their own religion". [[Mohammed Moussaoui]], head of the [[French Council of the Muslim Faith]], said his organisation deplores "the very mocking tone of the paper toward Islam and its prophet but reaffirms with force its total opposition to all acts and all forms of violence." [[François Fillon]], the prime minister, and [[Claude Guéant]], the interior minister, voiced support for ''Charlie Hebdo'',<ref name=FT01/> as did feminist writer [[Ayaan Hirsi Ali]], who criticised calls for self-censorship.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.torontosun.com/2011/11/09/extremists-hurt-non-militant-muslims-the-most|title=Extremists hurt non-militant Muslims the most|author=Peter Worthington|agency=QMI|newspaper=Toronto Sun|date=9 November 2011}}</ref>

===2012 cartoons===
In September 2012, the newspaper published a series of satirical cartoons of Muhammad, some of which feature nude caricatures of him.<ref>[http://www.bfmtv.com/societe/charlie-hebdo-publie-pages-interieures-caricatures-mahomet-338598.html "Charlie Hebdo publie des caricatures de Mahomet"].

Foreign Minister [[Laurent Fabius]] criticised the magazine's decision, saying, "In France, there is a principle of freedom of expression, which should not be undermined. In the present context, given this absurd video that has been aired, strong emotions have been awakened in many Muslim countries. Is it really sensible or intelligent to pour oil on the fire?"<ref name="clark">{{cite news |last=Clark |first=Nicola |title=French Magazine Publishes Cartoons Mocking Muhammad |newspaper= The New York Times |date=19 September 2012 |accessdate=19 September 2012 |url= http://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/20/world/europe/french-magazine-publishes-cartoons-mocking-muhammad.html}}</ref>  However, the newspaper's editor defended publication of the cartoons, saying, "We do caricatures of everyone, and above all every week, and when we do it with the Prophet, it's called provocation."<ref>{{cite news |title=French leaders sound alarm over planned Mohammad cartoons |agency=[[Reuters]] |date=18 September 2012 |url=http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/09/18/us-protests-france-cartoons-idUSBRE88H1CX20120918 |accessdate=18 September 2012}}</ref>

==2015 shooting==
On 7 January 2015, at least two gunmen opened fire at the Paris office of Charlie Hebdo, killing at least 12 (including two police officers), and seriously wounding at least 5. It was reported one of the police officers was executed with a gunshot to head. The gunmen were armed with guns and a rocket-propelled grenade, shouting "we have avenged the prophet" as they attacked.<ref>{{cite web|title=Deadly attack on office of French magazine Charlie Hebdo|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-30710883|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=7 January 2015}}</ref>
