    <aside class="right-rail-module rr-outbrain" data-name="rr-outbrain"><div class="OUTBRAIN" data-src="/web/20150109094958oe_/http://time.com/3661159/charlie-hebdo-suspects-siege/" data-widget-id="SB_2" data-ob-template="timemag"></div></aside><p>In what seemed like a last act of desperation, the prime suspects in Wednesday&#8217;s attack in Paris fired shots at French police as the massive dragnet closed on them and holed up in a factory northeast of the city, close to Charles de Gaulle Airport, with at least one hostage.</p>
<p>French officials offered few official details. But all signs pointed to an imminent climax in what has been a gruelling two-day chase for the heavily armed men. Police are convinced that Sa&iuml;d and Ch&eacute;rif Kouachi, 34 and 32, French-born brothers of Algerian immigrant parents, are the masked gunmen who pulled off France&#8217;s worst terror attack in modern times on Wednesday, when they stormed the offices of the satirical weekly paper <em>Charlie Hebdo</em> in ski masks armed with Kalashnikovs, and shot dead 12 people, including eight journalists and two police officers, before fleeing the scene in a getaway car.</p>
<p>Friday morning unfolded with dramatic speed and unpredictable turns, as about 80,000 police continued their mammoth manhunt for the prime suspects in Wednesday&#8217;s attack. Earlier in the morning, the brothers fled the manhunt around the wooded areas further north of Paris, in a Peugeot car they hijacked on the road, according to French media reports. Shortly after there was sounds of gunfire, as the suspects fled towards the printing workshop in an industrial zone close to Paris&#8217;s main airport. At least one runway was closed.</p>
<p>For the first time since Wednesday, French officials sounded confident that they were close to a climax in the manhunt. Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve told reporters on Friday morning that SWAT teams had the men cornered in a factory in Dammartin-en-Go&egrave;le, a small town northeast of Paris near the city&#8217;s main airport, and that crack forces were on site, ready to move in. &#8220;Operations will be conducted in the hours, the minutes,&#8221; he said shortly after 10 a.m.</p>
<p>Now, however, the manhunt involves a hostage negotiation. The Kouachis are believed to be heavily armed. On Thursday residents in the town of Villiers- Cotter&ecirc;ts, further north of Paris than the factory, said they had spotted the brothers with Kalashnikovs and rocket-propelled rocket launchers. Local hospital staff told reporters they were rushing medical teams to the site in readiness for casualties.</p><aside class="right-rail-module rr-ad" data-name="rr-ad"><div class="right-rail-ad" id="right-rail-ad-3661159"></div></aside><aside class="right-rail-module rr-share" data-name="rr-share"><span class="social-links">

police as the massive dragnet closed on them and holed up in a factory northeast of the city, close to Charles de Gaulle Airport, with at least one hostage.<\/p>\n<p>French officials offered few official details. But all signs pointed to an imminent climax in what has been a gruelling two-day chase for the heavily armed men. Police are convinced that Sa&iuml;d and Ch&eacute;rif Kouachi, 34 and 32, French-born brothers of Algerian immigrant parents, are the masked gunmen who pulled off France&#8217;s worst terror attack in modern times on Wednesday, when they stormed the offices of the satirical weekly paper <em>Charlie Hebdo<\/em> in ski masks armed with Kalashnikovs, and shot dead 12 people, including eight journalists and two police officers, before fleeing the scene in a getaway car.<\/p>\n<p>Friday morning unfolded with dramatic speed and unpredictable turns, as about 80,000 police continued their mammoth manhunt for the prime suspects in Wednesday&#8217;s attack. Earlier in the morning, the brothers fled the manhunt around the wooded areas further north of Paris, in a Peugeot car they hijacked on the road, according to French media reports. Shortly after there was sounds of gunfire, as the suspects fled towards the printing workshop in an industrial zone close to Paris&#8217;s main airport. At least one runway was closed.<\/p>\n<p>For the first time since Wednesday, French officials sounded confident that they were close to a climax in the manhunt. Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve told reporters on Friday morning that SWAT teams had the men cornered in a factory in Dammartin-en-Go&egrave;le, a small town northeast of Paris near the city&#8217;s main airport, and that crack forces were on site, ready to move in. &#8220;Operations will be conducted in the hours, the minutes,&#8221; he said shortly after 10 a.m.<\/p>\n<p>Now, however, the manhunt involves a hostage negotiation. The Kouachis are believed to be heavily armed. On Thursday residents in the town of Villiers- Cotter&ecirc;ts, further north of Paris than the factory, said they had spotted the brothers with Kalashnikovs and rocket-propelled rocket launchers. Local hospital staff told reporters they were rushing medical teams to the site in readiness for casualties.<\/p><aside class=\"right-rail-module rr-ad\" data-name=\"rr-ad\"><div class=\"right-rail-ad\" id=\"right-rail-ad-3661159\"><\/div><\/aside><aside class=\"right-rail-module rr-share\" data-name=\"rr-share\"><span class=\"social-links\">\n    <a class=\"time-icons time-icons-mail social-link-mail\" href=\"mailto:?subject=Paris%20Murder%20Suspects%20Cornered%20with%20Hostage%20%7C%20TIME&body=Paris%20Murder%20Suspects%20Cornered%20with%20Hostage%0A%0ABrothers%20exchanged%20fire%20with%20police%20before%20escaping%20into%20factory%0A%0Ahttp%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F3661159%2Fcharlie-hebdo-suspects-siege%2F\" data-event=\"email\" title=\"Click to Email this article\"><\/a>\n    <a class=\"time-icons time-icons-fb social-link-fb popup\" href=\"/web/20150109094958/https://www.facebook.com\/sharer\/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F3661159%2Fcharlie-hebdo-suspects-siege%2F\" data-event=\"fb-share\" title=\"Click to post this article to Facebook\"><\/a>\n    <a class=\"time-icons time-icons-tw social-link-tw popup\" href=\"#\" data-href=\"/web/20150109094958/https://twitter.com\/intent\/tweet?url=http%3A%2F%2Fti.me%2F1IxP3Jn&text=Paris%20murder%20suspects%20cornered%20with%20hostage&via=TIMEWorld\" data-event=\"tweet\" title=\"Click to Tweet this article\"><\/a>\n    <a class=\"time-icons time-icons-linkedin social-link-linkedin popup\" href=\"/web/20150109094958/http://www.linkedin.com\/shareArticle?mini=true&url=http%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F3661159%2Fcharlie-hebdo-suspects-siege%2F&title=Paris+Murder+Suspects+Cornered+with+Hostage\" data-event=\"linkedin\" title=\"Click to post this article to LinkedIn\"><\/a>\n    <a href=\"#\" class=\"time-icons time-icons-comment livefyre-commentcount toggle-comments\" data-lf-site-id=\"314099\" data-lf-article-id=\"3661159\" data-url=\"/web/20150109094958/http://time.com\/3661159\/charlie-hebdo-suspects-siege\/\" data-title=\"Paris Murder Suspects Cornered with Hostage\" title=\"Click to view and post comments\" data-event=\"comment-click\">0<\/a>\n<\/span>\n<\/aside>","read_more":true,"section":{"name":"World","slug":"world","url":"/web/20150109094958/http://time.com\/world\/","description":"The latest news and analysis from TIME's correspondents on world politics, diplomacy, conflict, culture, humanitarian disasters, religion and much more","world":true},"tag":{"name":"France","slug":"france","url":"/web/20150109094958/http://time.com\/tag\/france\/"},"tags":"France","id":3661159,"encoded_url":"http%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F3661159%2Fcharlie-hebdo-suspects-siege%2F","encoded_shortlink":"http%3A%2F%2Fti.me%2F1IxP3Jn","encoded_title":"Paris+Murder+Suspects+Cornered+with+Hostage","twitter_text":"Paris%20murder%20suspects%20cornered%20with%20hostage","twitter_via":"TIMEWorld","subjects":[null],"ads":{"neg":"false","post_title":"Paris Murder Suspects Cornered with Hostage"},"Partner_Module":{"partner":"Select","post_title":"Paris Murder Suspects Cornered with Hostage"},"email_title":"Paris%20Murder%20Suspects%20Cornered%20with%20Hostage%20%7C%20TIME","email_body":"Paris%20Murder%20Suspects%20Cornered%20with%20Hostage%0A%0ABrothers%20exchanged%20fire%20with%20police%20before%20escaping%20into%20factory%0A%0Ahttp%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F3661159%2Fcharlie-hebdo-suspects-siege%2F","omniture":{"modules":"rr-outbrain|rr-ad|rr-share"},"outbrain":{"url":"/web/20150109094958/http://time.com\/3661159\/charlie-hebdo-suspects-siege\/","widget_id":"AR_6"}},"latest":{"articles":[{"url":"/web/20150109094958/http://time.com\/3661143\/charlie-hebdo-islamist-paris-france-manhunt-al-qaeda-kouachi-jesuischarlie\/","right_now":true,"shortlink":"/web/20150109094958/http://ti.me\/1tSdeRI","title":"Brothers&#8217;

The weekly newspaper had been repeatedly threatened &mdash; and its offices were firebombed in 2011 &mdash; after spoofing Islam and depicting the Prophet Muhammad in caricature.<\/p>\n<p>Heavily armed security forces with air cover moved along country roads and among old stone buildings. The country&#8217;s maximum terror alert was extended from Paris to the northern Picardie region, focusing on towns that might be safe havens for Cherif Kouachi, 32, and Said Kouachi, 34.<\/p>\n<div class=\"galleryContainer galleryContainer--embedded\" data-gallery=\"3659304\" data-size=\"default\"><\/div>\n<p>Prime Minister Manuel Valls said both men were known to intelligence services.<\/p>\n<p>A senior U.S. official said Thursday the elder Kouachi had traveled to Yemen, although it was unclear whether he was there to join extremist groups like al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula, which is based there.<\/p>\n<p>The younger brother, Cherif, was convicted of terrorism charges in 2008 for his links to a network sending jihadis to fight American forces in Iraq.<\/p>\n<p>Both were also on the U.S. no-fly list, a senior U.S. counterterrorism official said.

In all, 90 people, many of them witnesses to the grisly assault on the satirical weekly Charlie Hebdo, were questioned for information on the attackers, Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve said in a statement.<\/p>\n<p>The minister confirmed reports the men were identified by the elder brother&#8217;s ID card, left in an abandoned getaway car, a slip that contrasted with the seeming professionalism of the attack.<\/p>\n<p>A third suspect, 18-year-old Mourad Hamyd, surrendered at a police station Wednesday evening after hearing his name linked to the attacks. His relationship to the Kouachi brothers was unclear.<\/p>\n<p>The Kouachi brothers &mdash; born in Paris to Algerian parents &mdash; were well-known to French counterterrorism authorities. Cherif Kouachi, a former pizza deliveryman, had appeared in a 2005 French TV documentary on Islamic extremism and was sentenced to 18 months in prison in 2008 for trying to join up with fighters battling in Iraq.<\/p>\n<p>Charlie Hebdo had long drawn threats for its depictions of Islam, although it also satirized other religions and political figures. The weekly paper had caricatured the Prophet Muhammad, and a sketch of Islamic State&#8217;s leader was the last tweet sent out by the irreverent newspaper, minutes before the attack. Nothing has been tweeted since.<\/p>\n<p>Eight journalists, two police officers, a maintenance worker and a visitor were killed in the attack.<\/p>\n<div class=\"galleryContainer galleryContainer--embedded\" data-gallery=\"3658798\" data-size=\"default\"><\/div>\n<p>Charlie Hebdo planned a special edition next week, produced in the offices of another paper.<\/p>\n<p>Editor Stephane Charbonnier, known as Charb, who was among those slain, &#8220;symbolized secularism &#8230; the combat against fundamentalism,&#8221; his companion, Jeannette Bougrab, said on BFM-TV.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;He was ready to die for his ideas,&#8221; she said.<\/p>\n<p>Authorities around Europe have warned of the threat posed by the return of Western jihadis trained in warfare. France counts at least 1,200 citizens in the war zone in Syria &mdash; headed there, returned or dead. Both the Islamic State group and al-Qaida have threatened France &mdash; home to Western Europe&#8217;s largest Muslim population.<\/p>\n<p>The French suspect in a deadly 2014 attack on a Jewish museum in Belgium had returned from fighting with extremists in Syria; and the man who rampaged in southern France in 2012, killing three soldiers and four people at a Jewish school, received

It offers a good snapshot but it has some shortcomings. Because it logs symptoms in addition to diagnosed cases, there&rsquo;s a chance that some of the fever and respiratory problems could be something else entirely. It also doesn&rsquo;t record the countless people who likely just decide to weather out their illness at home with over-the-counter remedies or some chicken soup. There&rsquo;s also a lag in the reporting, which means FluView can&rsquo;t provide a real-time look at what the virus is doing at a given time.<\/p>\n<p>The CDC has an epidemiologist studying alternative ways of collecting flu information, including crowdsourcing, to see if the CDC can provide more real time data. &ldquo;There is potential there,&rdquo; says Lynnette Brammer, an epidemiologist in the influenza division at CDC. &ldquo;But with any data set you&rsquo;ve got to know how to appropriately interpret that data and when you might be over reaching.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p><strong>MORE:<\/strong> <a title=\"Why Some Experts Want Mandatory Flu Shots For School Kids\" href=\"/web/20150109094958/http://time.com\/3657461\/mandatory-flu-shots\/\" target=\"_blank\"><span class=\"item-title\">Why Some Experts Want Mandatory Flu Shots For School Kids<\/span><\/a><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"/web/20150109094958/https://itunes.apple.com\/us\/app\/flu-near-you\/id570301361?mt=8\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Flu Near You:<\/strong><\/a><\/p>\n<p>This app is more granular, portraying in real time the actual level of flu activity in a given area. It can pinpoint your location down to the street and give you a low-moderate-high reading on flu activity. It&rsquo;s based on self reports from people who register on the app and voluntarily provide information on their sniffle status on a weekly basis. Blue dots indicate people who are still symptom-free, while yellow dots indicate people who might have some of the symptoms of flu &mdash; including fever, coughs, or sore throats &mdash; and red dots represent people who meet the CDC criteria for influenza-like illness: fever over 100F and a cough or sore throat that&rsquo;s not caused by any other known infection.<\/p>\n<p>Self-reporting may not provide an entirely accurate picture either, however. To address such confounding factors, Flu Near Your deletes the first two reports by newcomers, to reduce the possibility that new users are just playing around with the app, but there&rsquo;s still no way to verify the symptoms that people log in. But so far, Mark Smolinski, director of global health for Skoll Foundation Global Health Threats, which created the app, is confident that the reports are valid, since they track pretty well with the CDC data.<\/p><div class=\"content-ad\" id=\"content-ad-3659809\"><\/div>\n<p>Alexis de Belloy, who pores over the Flu Near You data, says that registration for the app is up 40% compared to last year, and the proportion of them who actively respond to the weekly surveys is also up; the more participants, the stronger and more reliable the signal generated by the users.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"/web/20150109094958/http://cpid.iri.columbia.edu\/flu.html\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>The Flu Forecaster:<\/strong><\/a><\/p>\n<p>Jeffrey Shaman, professor of at the Mailman School of Public Health at Columbia University, decided to combine a bit of both the CDC and real-time strategies into his <a href=\"/web/20150109094958/http://cpid.iri.columbia.edu\/flu.html\" target=\"_blank\">flu forecaster<\/a>, which he launched last year. You can select your city and receive a chart of when flu is likely to peak where you live. It&rsquo;s based on the same predictive modeling that weather forecasters use &mdash; combining information from past flu seasons and current trends to make educated guesses about the ebb and flow of cases in the future. &ldquo;There are problems with all data, so I don&rsquo;t think any data should be used in isolation,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;We should consider them all until we have that gold standard.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>And it&rsquo;s not just an academic exercise. Smolinski points out that critical public health information can be gleaned from flu tracking and forecasting, such as how effective a particular flu season&rsquo;s vaccine is. By comparing rates of illness among people who have been vaccinated and those who haven&rsquo;t, doctors can get a good sense of whether the shot is a good match for circulating flu strains or not.

Their system, <a href=\"/web/20150109094958/http://www.flutracking.net\/Info\" target=\"_blank\">FluTracking.net<\/a>, asks participants about whether they have had a fever or cough every week during the flu season; since the program began in 2006, more than 16,000 people now complete the survey regularly.

Now it looks like it probably won New Year&rsquo;s too. The company just revealed that New Year&rsquo;s Day was the largest sales day ever for the App Store, which sells apps for the iPhone, iPad and iPod Touch. During the first week of January, customers spent nearly $500 million on iOS apps, a new record for Apple.<\/p>\n<p>2014 wasn&rsquo;t a shabby year for the App Store either. Apple said app sales rose 50 percent year-over-year and the company paid out $10 billion to developers in 2014. Since Apple keeps 30% of the revenue from each App Store transaction, that means the company pocketed about $4.3 billion from app transactions last year. Overall, developers have earned about $25 billion from app sales since the App Store launched in 2008, putting Apple&rsquo;s total take above $10 billion.<\/p>\n<p>Cultivating a user base that spends lots of money on apps remains one of Apple&rsquo;s key advantages over Google and its Android operating system. Though the vast majority of smartphones today run on Android, the App Store&rsquo;s global revenue was 60% higher than revenue from the Google Play Store in the third quarter of 2014, according to mobile analytics firm App Annie.<\/p>\n<aside class=\"right-rail-module rr-share\" data-name=\"rr-share\"><span class=\"social-links\">\n    <a class=\"time-icons time-icons-mail social-link-mail\" href=\"mailto:?subject=Apple%E2%80%99s%20App%20Store%20Just%20Had%20Its%20Biggest%20Day%20Ever%20%7C%20TIME&body=Apple%E2%80%99s%20App%20Store%20Just%20Had%20Its%20Biggest%20Day%20Ever%0A%0ACustomers%20spent%20half%20a%20billion%20dollars%20on%20apps%20in%20a%20single%20week%0A%0Ahttp%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F3659871%2Fapple-app-store-revenue%2F\" data-event=\"email\" title=\"Click to Email this article\"><\/a>\n    <a class=\"time-icons time-icons-fb social-link-fb popup\" href=\"/web/20150109094958/https://www.facebook.com\/sharer\/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F3659871%2Fapple-app-store-revenue%2F\" data-event=\"fb-share\" title=\"Click to post this article to Facebook\"><\/a>\n    <a class=\"time-icons time-icons-tw social-link-tw popup\" href=\"#\" data-href=\"/web/20150109094958/https://twitter.com\/intent\/tweet?url=http%3A%2F%2Fti.me%2F1yFF98C&text=Apple%27s%20App%20Store%20just%20had%20its%20biggest%20day%20ever&via=Techland\" data-event=\"tweet\" title=\"Click to Tweet this article\"><\/a>\n    <a class=\"time-icons time-icons-linkedin social-link-linkedin popup\" href=\"/web/20150109094958/http://www.linkedin.com\/shareArticle?mini=true&url=http%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F3659871%2Fapple-app-store-revenue%2F&title=Apple%E2%80%99s+App+Store+Just+Had+Its+Biggest+Day+Ever\" data-event=\"linkedin\" title=\"Click to post this article to LinkedIn\"><\/a>\n    <a href=\"#\" class=\"time-icons time-icons-comment livefyre-commentcount toggle-comments\" data-lf-site-id=\"314099\" data-lf-article-id=\"3659871\" data-url=\"/web/20150109094958/http://time.com\/3659871\/apple-app-store-revenue\/\" data-title=\"Apple\u2019s App Store Just Had Its Biggest Day Ever\" title=\"Click to view and post comments\" data-event=\"comment-click\">0<\/a>\n<\/span>\n<\/aside>","read_more":true,"section":{"name":"Tech","slug":"tech","url":"/web/20150109094958/http://time.com\/tech\/","description":"Technology news, reviews, how-to's and analysis of smartphones, tablets, computers, apps, video games, streaming media, innovation, social networks and more","tech":true},"tag":{"name":"apps","slug":"apps","url":"/web/20150109094958/http://time.com\/tag\/apps\/"},"tags":"Android|App store|Apple|apps|Google|Google Play","id":3659871,"encoded_url":"http%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F3659871%2Fapple-app-store-revenue%2F","encoded_shortlink":"http%3A%2F%2Fti.me%2F1yFF98C","encoded_title":"Apple%E2%80%99s+App+Store+Just+Had+Its+Biggest+Day+Ever","twitter_text":"Apple%27s%20App%20Store%20just%20had%20its%20biggest%20day%20ever","twitter_via":"Techland","subjects":[null],"ads":{"neg":"false","post_title":"Apple\u2019s App Store Just Had Its Biggest Day Ever"},"Partner_Module":{"partner":"Select","post_title":"Apple\u2019s App Store Just Had Its Biggest Day Ever"},"email_title":"Apple%E2%80%99s%20App%20Store%20Just%20Had%20Its%20Biggest%20Day%20Ever%20%7C%20TIME","email_body":"Apple%E2%80%99s%20App%20Store%20Just%20Had%20Its%20Biggest%20Day%20Ever%0A%0ACustomers%20spent%20half%20a%20billion%20dollars%20on%20apps%20in%20a%20single%20week%0A%0Ahttp%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F3659871%2Fapple-app-store-revenue%2F","omniture":{"modules":"rr-share"},"outbrain":{"url":"/web/20150109094958/http://time.com\/3659871\/apple-app-store-revenue\/","widget_id":"AR_6"}},{"url":"/web/20150109094958/http://time.com\/3660290\/ohio-lethal-injection-sodium-thiopental\/","right_now":true,"shortlink":"/web/20150109094958/http://ti.me\/1w3U7OL","title":"Ohio Abandons Controversial Execution Drug Cocktail","friendly_title":"Ohio Abandons Controversial Execution Drug Cocktail","post_type":"post","available":true,"time_article":true,"comments_allowed":true,"short_title":"Ohio Switches Up Lethal-Injection Drugs","excerpt":"The state is dropping a controversial drug while delaying executions","format":"article","modified_time":{"pretty":"Jan. 8, 2015 5:14 PM","published":"2015-01-08 23:52:05","updated":"2015-01-09 04:52:05","minute":"3:20 pm","short":"1\/8"},"authors":[{"id":53044265,"url":"/web/20150109094958/http://time.com\/author\/josh-sanburn\/","name":"Josh Sanburn","bio":"Josh Sanburn is a writer for TIME.com.

The state also postponed the upcoming Feb. 11 execution of Ronald Phillips, who was convicted of raping and murdering a 3-year-old girl. Others may also be delayed due to the changes.<\/p>\n<p>Midazolam has come under scrutiny by anesthesiologists and lethal injection experts, who say it inadequately sedates inmates during executions. The drug was first used last January in the lethal injection of Dennis McGuire, who was convicted of raping and killing Joy Stewart in 1989. In the roughly 25-minute execution, McGuire reportedly snored and snorted on the gurney table, leading to a moratorium on executions in the state and a review of its lethal injection protocol.<\/p>\n<p>In April, Ohio announced that it was <a href=\"/web/20150109094958/http://time.com\/80092\/ohio-lethal-injection-dosages-execution\/\">increasing the dosage<\/a> of both midazolam and hydromorphone given to inmates while insisting that the McGuire execution was conducted in a constitutional manner.<\/p>\n<p>The executions of Clayton Lockett in Oklahoma and Joseph Wood in Arizona, both widely considered botched, also used midazolam.<\/p>\n<p>(<strong>MORE:<\/strong> <a href=\"/web/20150109094958/http://nation.time.com\/2014\/01\/17\/ohios-grisly-execution-history\/\">Ohio&#8217;s Grisly Execution History<\/a>)<\/p>\n<p>Ohio is often a first mover in how lethal injections are performed in the U.S., and states frequently follow its lead. Ohio was the first to use sodium thiopental in a one-drug protocol in 2009, the first to use pentobarbital in 2011 and the first to use midazolam last year. Now, other states may follow in its footsteps in using sodium thiopental.<\/p>\n<p>One thing that remains unclear, however, is where Ohio plans to get the drug, which it stopped using in 2011 when Hospira, a Lake Forest, Ill.-based pharmaceutical company, stopped making it. But officials may believe that they&#8217;ll be able to attain it from compounding pharmacies that are now shielded by a bill <a href=\"/web/20150109094958/http://www.dispatch.com\/content\/stories\/local\/2014\/12\/19\/new-law-will-keep-lethal-injection-drug-supplier-secret.html\" target=\"_blank\">signed into law by Gov. John Kasich<\/a> in December that allows pharmaceutical companies to supply drugs anonymously.<\/p>\n<p>Sodium thiopental now joins pentobarbital, both barbiturates that can depress the central

data-ob-template=\"timemag\"><\/div><\/aside><p>Indonesia says it has detected signals from the black-box recorders of downed AirAsia Flight QZ 8501 and is racing to reach them.<\/p>\n<p>S.B. Supriyadi, director of operations for Indonesia&rsquo;s National Search and Rescue Agency (Basarnas) in Pangkalan Bun &mdash; the Borneo town that has become the center for search operations &mdash; <a href=\"/web/20150109094958/http://www.bbc.com\/news\/world-asia-30738613\" target=\"_blank\">told<\/a> the BBC, &#8220;A ship detected the pings. The divers are trying to reach it.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>A <a href=\"/web/20150109094958/http://www.reuters.com\/article\/2015\/01\/09\/us-indonesia-airplane-idUSKBN0KG09L20150109\" target=\"_blank\">salvage operation<\/a> involving helicopters and lifting balloons was also launched Friday in a bid to recover the tail section of the jet, which lies at a depth of 30 m (100 ft.) in the Java Sea, about 30 km (20 miles) from where the flight lost contact with air-traffic control, Reuters reports.<\/p>\n<p>Authorities had been hopeful that the flight-data recorders would be found with the tail, since the flight recorders are housed in that section of the Airbus A320-200. But Santoso Sayogo, an official at Indonesia&#8217;s National Transportation Safety Committee, told Reuters it appeared the boxes and tail were not together.<\/p>\n<p>The crash of the AirAsia jet &mdash; which went down on Dec. 28 with 162 on board as it flew from Indonesia&#8217;s second city Surabaya to Singapore &mdash; has meanwhile given fresh impetus to the use of ejectable black boxes on commercial flights. These are flight-data recorders that can be deployed from a descending aircraft and float on water, instead of creating the recovery problems that salvage crews are now facing.<\/p>\n<p>Citing an anonymous official from the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), Reuters <a href=\"/web/20150109094958/http://www.reuters.com\/article\/2015\/01\/08\/us-indonesia-plane-blackboxes-analysis-idUSKBN0KH0BX20150108\" target=\"_blank\">reports<\/a> that ejectable black boxes will be on the agenda at an important ICAO safety conference next month.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;The time has come that deployable recorders are going to get a serious look,&#8221; the official told the news agency.<\/p>\n<p>Ejectable data recorders are already used on military aircraft and on many helicopters, but they are more expensive to produce and have not been tested on large commercial jets.<\/p>\n<p>However, some experts believe that transmitting data in real time would be a better option.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;The current fixed recorders are highly reliable and cost effective and it is rare to not recover them,&#8221; Mike Poole, a Canadian authority on flight recorders, told Reuters.<\/p><aside class=\"right-rail-module rr-ad\" data-name=\"rr-ad\"><div class=\"right-rail-ad\"

Such things are by no means unheard of: just about every galaxy has a supermassive black hole lurking at its core, and when two galaxies merge, as they <a href=\"/web/20150109094958/http://time.com\/135327\/the-milky-way-and-the-andromeda-nebula-are-going-to-collide\/\" target=\"_blank\">often do<\/a>, their central black holes orbit each other in an ever-tightening dance, and in many cases they eventually <a href=\"/web/20150109094958/http://time.com\/3595492\/black-hole-ejected-galaxy\/\" target=\"_blank\">coalesce into one<\/a>. When that happens, says General Relativity, they should trigger ripples in the fabric of spacetime itself, in the form of so-called gravitational waves that Einstein predicted, but that no one has yet detected directly.<\/p>\n<p>Such a merger hasn&#8217;t ever been seen, but astronomers have just announced the discovery of the next best thing: a pair of supermassive black holes orbiting each other more closely than any ever before observed. Other twin black holes won&#8217;t merge for another few billion years, but these, says Caltech&#8217;s George Djorgovski, co-author of a paper in <em>Nature<\/em> describing the new discovery, &#8220;could merge in a mere million years.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>That still sounds like a long time, but it means the two black holes are virtually on top of each other&mdash;on a cosmic scale at least. If one were sitting in the Sun&#8217;s position, the other might be as close as the Oort Cloud of comets that sits at the edge of the Solar System. That&#8217;s crucial: astrophysicists don&#8217;t really know what happens in the last stages of the spiraling-in process&mdash;it&#8217;s known as the &#8220;<a href=\"/web/20150109094958/http://en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Binary_black_hole#The_final-parsec_problem\" target=\"_blank\">final parsec problem<\/a>,&#8221; a parsec being a bit over three light-years. And these two are very much in the thick of it.<\/p><div class=\"content-ad\" id=\"content-ad-3657299\"><\/div>\n<p>Djorgovski and his colleagues hasten to say they haven&#8217;t seen the black holes as individual objects: instead, they&#8217;re looking at the bright spot of light that marks the &#8220;accretion disk&#8221; of superheated gas that often surrounds black holes. Accretion disks flicker sometimes, as new gas is pulled in, but in the case of this object, known as PG 1302-102, the flicker is periodic, waxing and waning over a period of about five years. That&#8217;s the telltale sign that two objects are involved: one of the black holes&#8217; accretion disks may be warped somehow by the gravity of the other, causing a hot spot that flashes us as it rotates into view.<\/p>\n<p>What the astronomers are hoping for now is to find more examples like this. They have some 20 candidates already, and the more twin black holes they can find that are in tight orbits, the better they can understand what&#8217;s really going on. We may not be around to see PG 1302-102&#8217;s final collision&mdash;if it ever takes place&mdash;but somewhere out there, two black holes may be even closer to tangling.<\/p>\n<p><em>Read next: <a href=\"/web/20150109094958/http://www.time.com\/3657884\/best-booths-ces-2015\/?xid=time_readnext\" target=\"_blank\">The 20 Most Eye-Catching Booths at CES 2015<\/a><\/em><\/p><aside class=\"right-rail-module rr-ad\" data-name=\"rr-ad\"><div class=\"right-rail-ad\" id=\"right-rail-ad-3657299\"><\/div><\/aside><aside class=\"right-rail-module rr-share\" data-name=\"rr-share\"><span class=\"social-links\">\n    <a class=\"time-icons time-icons-mail social-link-mail\" href=\"mailto:?subject=Ka-Boom%21%20Two%20Black%20Holes%20Get%20Ready%20to%20Collide%20%7C%20TIME&body=Ka-Boom%21%20Two%20Black%20Holes%20Get%20Ready%20to%20Collide%0A%0AA%20dance%20of%20death%20that%27s%20never%20been%20seen%20before%20is%20slowly%20unfolding%20now%0A%0Ahttp%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F3657299%2Fblack-hole-collision%2F\" data-event=\"email\" title=\"Click to Email this article\"><\/a>\n    <a class=\"time-icons time-icons-fb social-link-fb popup\" href=\"/web/20150109094958/https://www.facebook.com\/sharer\/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F3657299%2Fblack-hole-collision%2F\" data-event=\"fb-share\" title=\"Click to post this article to Facebook\"><\/a>\n    <a class=\"time-icons time-icons-tw social-link-tw popup\" href=\"#\" data-href=\"/web/20150109094958/https://twitter.com\/intent\/tweet?url=http%3A%2F%2Fti.me%2F1yAgQJc&text=Ka-Boom%21%20Two%20black%20holes%20get%20ready%20to%20collide&via=TIME\" data-event=\"tweet\" title=\"Click to Tweet this article\"><\/a>\n    <a class=\"time-icons time-icons-linkedin social-link-linkedin popup\" href=\"/web/20150109094958/http://www.linkedin.com\/shareArticle?mini=true&url=http%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F3657299%2Fblack-hole-collision%2F&title=Ka-Boom%21+Two+Black+Holes+Get+Ready+to+Collide\" data-event=\"linkedin\" title=\"Click to post this article to LinkedIn\"><\/a>\n    <a href=\"#\" class=\"time-icons time-icons-comment livefyre-commentcount toggle-comments\" data-lf-site-id=\"314099\" data-lf-article-id=\"3657299\" data-url=\"/web/20150109094958/http://time.com\/3657299\/black-hole-collision\/\" data-title=\"Ka-Boom!

They were pastors at the New Christ Memorial Church in the Los Angeles suburb of San Fernando.<\/p>\n<p>Born in San Francisco, Crouch wrote his first gospel tune at age 14.<\/p>\n<p>Crouch wrote dozens of songs, including gospel favorites such as &#8220;The Blood Will Never Lose Its Power,&#8221; &#8221;My Tribute (To God Be the Glory)&#8221; and &#8220;Soon and Very Soon,&#8221; which was sung at a public memorial to Jackson.<\/p>\n<p>Debuting in 1960, Crouch helped pioneer the burgeoning &#8220;Jesus Music&#8221; movement from the late 1960s and &#8217;70s that started the spread of contemporary Christian music.<\/p>\n<p>His influence also crossed over into in pop music. Elvis Presley performed his song &#8220;I&#8217;ve Got Confidence&#8221; for a 1972 gospel album, and Paul Simon&#8221; recorded &#8220;Jesus Is the Answer&#8221; for a 1974 live album.<\/p>\n<p>Crouch worked with many other stars, from Diana Ross to Ringo Starr, and his gospel albums sometimes featured performers from other musical genres. His 18th solo album, &#8220;The Journey,&#8221; released in 2011, featured Chaka Khan, Shelia E., Take 6, Kim Burrell and Marvin Winans.<\/p><div class=\"content-ad\" id=\"content-ad-3661084\"><\/div>\n<p>Crouch was one of only a handful of gospel performers to have a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.<\/p>\n<p>His choir, The Disciples, sang background for Madonna&#8217;s song &#8220;Like a Prayer.&#8221; Crouch helped Michael Jackson arrange the King of Pop&#8217;s 1987 hit song, &#8220;Man in the Mirror.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>He also arranged music for the 1985 film &#8220;The Color Purple&#8221; &mdash; which earned him an Academy Award nomination &mdash; and Disney&#8217;s &#8220;The Lion King&#8221; in 1994.<\/p>\n<p>His success came despite a lifelong struggle with dyslexia. To create, he would make drawings that allowed him to grasp the concept. For the Jackson song, he drew a mirror with an image in it.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;I memorized everything through sight, the shape of the word,&#8221; Crouch told The Associated Press in 2011. &#8220;Some things that I write, you&#8217;ll see a page with cartoon pictures or a drawing of a car &mdash; like a Ford &mdash; or a flag. I still do it on an occasion when a word is strange to me.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;So when I finish a song, I thank God for bringing me through,&#8221; he continued. &#8220;You have to press on and know your calling. That&#8217;s what I&#8217;ve been doing for all my life. I just went forward.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Crouch said his dyslexia contributed to his success.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;If I was sharp in every area, I might be too big-headed or something,&#8221; he said.<\/p>\n<p>Crouch had health issues in recent years, including diabetes and cancer. Last month, he was hospitalized for pneumonia and congestive heart failure and had to cancel a tour.<\/p><aside class=\"right-rail-module rr-ad\" data-name=\"rr-ad\"><div class=\"right-rail-ad\"

target=\"_blank\">finally<\/a> coming to fruition.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Mayor Bill de Blasio&#8217;s administration announced Thursday that stores, food service establishments and manufacturers won&#8217;t be able to possess, sell or offer single-use styrofoam containers or cups &mdash; even &#8220;packing peanuts&#8221; &mdash; beginning July 1. The reason is purely environmental, as Expanded Polystyrene Foam cannot be recycled.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">&#8220;These products cause real environmental harm and have no place in New York City. We have better options, better alternatives, and if more cities across the country follow our lead and institute similar bans, those alternatives will soon become more plentiful and will cost less,&rdquo; said de Blasio. &ldquo;By removing nearly 30,000 tons of expanded polystyrene waste from our landfills, streets and waterways, today&rsquo;s announcement is a major step towards our goal of a greener, greater New York City.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>The containers are popular not only in restaurants that offer a takeout option but also among the hundreds of food carts and trucks that populate New York&#8217;s streets. Such vendors will have to seek out recyclable alternatives, though businesses with less than $500,ooo in annual revenue can apply for exemptions if using alternative containers would cause &#8220;undue financial hardship.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Though New York is the largest city to ban this type of &#8220;dirty foam,&#8221; other cities including San Francisco, Seattle and Portland have enacted similar measures.<\/p><aside class=\"right-rail-module rr-ad\" data-name=\"rr-ad\"><div class=\"right-rail-ad\" id=\"right-rail-ad-3660943\"><\/div><\/aside><aside class=\"right-rail-module rr-share\" data-name=\"rr-share\"><span class=\"social-links\">\n    <a class=\"time-icons time-icons-mail social-link-mail\" href=\"mailto:?subject=New%20York%20City%20Bans%20Single-Use%20Styrofoam%20Products%20%7C%20TIME&body=New%20York%20City%20Bans%20Single-Use%20Styrofoam%20Products%0A%0ABan%20will%20go%20into%20effect%20July%201%0A%0Ahttp%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F3660943%2Fnew-york-city-styrofoam-ban%2F\" data-event=\"email\" title=\"Click to Email this article\"><\/a>\n    <a class=\"time-icons time-icons-fb social-link-fb popup\" href=\"/web/20150109094958/https://www.facebook.com\/sharer\/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F3660943%2Fnew-york-city-styrofoam-ban%2F\" data-event=\"fb-share\" title=\"Click to post this article to Facebook\"><\/a>\n    <a class=\"time-icons time-icons-tw social-link-tw popup\" href=\"#\" data-href=\"/web/20150109094958/https://twitter.com\/intent\/tweet?url=http%3A%2F%2Fti.me%2F1tRHdt0&text=New%20York%20City%20bans%20single-use%20styrofoam%20products&via=TIME\" data-event=\"tweet\" title=\"Click to Tweet this article\"><\/a>\n    <a class=\"time-icons time-icons-linkedin social-link-linkedin popup\" href=\"/web/20150109094958/http://www.linkedin.com\/shareArticle?mini=true&url=http%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F3660943%2Fnew-york-city-styrofoam-ban%2F&title=New+York+City+Bans+Single-Use+Styrofoam+Products\" data-event=\"linkedin\" title=\"Click to post this article to LinkedIn\"><\/a>\n    <a href=\"#\" class=\"time-icons time-icons-comment livefyre-commentcount toggle-comments\" data-lf-site-id=\"314099\" data-lf-article-id=\"3660943\" data-url=\"/web/20150109094958/http://time.com\/3660943\/new-york-city-styrofoam-ban\/\" data-title=\"New York City Bans Single-Use Styrofoam Products\" title=\"Click to view and post comments\" data-event=\"comment-click\">0<\/a>\n<\/span>\n<\/aside>","read_more":true,"section":{"name":"U.S.","slug":"us","url":"/web/20150109094958/http://time.com\/us\/","description":"The latest news and analysis on crime, religion, education, transportation, weather, immigration, sports, drugs, the law, and other news from around the nation","us":true},"tag":{"name":"cities","slug":"cities","url":"/web/20150109094958/http://time.com\/tag\/cities\/"},"tags":"cities|Environment|New York City","hero":{"class":"landscape","mini":"/web/20150109094958/http://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2015\/01\/457939109.jpg?w=74&h=74&crop=1","thumbnail":"/web/20150109094958/http://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2015\/01\/457939109.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1","src":{"small":"/web/20150109094958/http://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2015\/01\/457939109.jpg?w=280","small_2x":"/web/20150109094958/http://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2015\/01\/457939109.jpg?w=560","large":"/web/20150109094958/http://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2015\/01\/457939109.jpg?w=550","large_2x":"/web/20150109094958/http://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2015\/01\/457939109.jpg?w=1100"},"credit":"Spencer Platt&mdash;Getty Images","caption":"A food cart worker fills a styrofoam take-out container with food for a customer on December 19, 2013 in New York City.

But all signs pointed to an imminent climax in what has been a gruelling two-day chase for the heavily armed men. Police are convinced that Sa&iuml;d and Ch&eacute;rif Kouachi, 34 and 32, French-born brothers of Algerian immigrant parents, are the masked gunmen who pulled off France&#8217;s worst terror attack in modern times on Wednesday, when they stormed the offices of the satirical weekly paper <em>Charlie Hebdo<\/em> in ski masks armed with Kalashnikovs, and shot dead 12 people, including eight journalists and two police officers, before fleeing the scene in a getaway car.<\/p>\n<p>Friday morning unfolded with dramatic speed and unpredictable turns, as about 80,000 police continued their mammoth manhunt for the prime suspects in Wednesday&#8217;s attack. Earlier in the morning, the brothers fled the manhunt around the wooded areas further north of Paris, in a Peugeot car they hijacked on the road, according to French media reports. Shortly after there was sounds of gunfire, as the suspects fled towards the printing workshop in an industrial zone close to Paris&#8217;s main airport. At least one runway was closed.<\/p>\n<p>For the first time since Wednesday, French officials sounded confident that they were close to a climax in the manhunt. Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve told reporters on Friday morning that SWAT teams had the men cornered in a factory in Dammartin-en-Go&egrave;le, a small town northeast of Paris near the city&#8217;s main airport, and that crack forces were on site, ready to move in. &#8220;Operations will be conducted in the hours, the minutes,&#8221; he said shortly after 10 a.m.<\/p>\n<p>Now, however, the manhunt involves a hostage negotiation. The Kouachis are believed to be heavily armed. On Thursday residents in the town of Villiers- Cotter&ecirc;ts, further north of Paris than the factory, said they had spotted the brothers with Kalashnikovs and rocket-propelled rocket launchers. Local hospital staff told reporters they were rushing medical teams to the site in readiness for casualties.<\/p><aside class=\"right-rail-module rr-ad\" data-name=\"rr-ad\"><div

out in high numbers to participate in the ballot on Thursday, had other ideas.<\/p>\n<p>Early returns <a href=\"/web/20150109094958/http://time.com\/3661002\/sri-lanka-rajapaksa-defeat-sirisena-election\/\" target=\"_blank\">on Friday<\/a> spectacularly showed up that &ldquo;inborn power,&rdquo; spelling triumph for Maithripala Sirisena, a 63-year-old former Rajapaksa ally and health minister who announced a surprise run for the presidency a day after his ex-boss called the snap election in November. Shortly before declaring his hand, Sirisena had dined with the former President, who, after bringing a long-running civil war with Tamil separatists to an end in 2009, had secured a second term in office with a landslide victory in 2010. (<a href=\"/web/20150109094958/http://www.amnestyusa.org\/our-%20work\/countries\/asia-and-the- pacific\/sri-lanka\" target=\"_blank\">Both sides<\/a> are accused of human rights abuses in the conflict, which lasted 26 years.)<\/p>\n<p>At the time, Rajapaksa&mdash;who followed up his re-election with measures to remove presidential term limits and concentrate executive authority in his office&mdash;seemed assured of another victory, with his grip over the machinery of government tighter than ever. His brother Gotabaya looked after the defense department; another sibling, Basil, was responsible for economic development; and a third, Chamal, oversaw the Sri Lankan legislature as speaker.<\/p>\n<p>The opposition accused the President and his clan of abuses of power and plundering the nation&rsquo;s wealth. But Rajapaksa confidently shrugged off such allegations, safe in the knowledge that, whatever opposition parties might say, they did not have a viable alternative candidate for the January race.<\/p>\n<p>That changed with the arrival of Sirisena, who, like Rajapaksa, belongs to the country&rsquo;s Sinhalese majority. His emergence from within the President&rsquo;s fold turned what looked set to be a coronation for Rajapaksa into a gripping contest, as opposition groups, including the country&rsquo;s main Tamil party, backed Sirisena&#8217;s candidacy. (Rajapaksa&rsquo;s isolation came into sharp focus <a href=\"/web/20150109094958/http://www.abc.net.au\/news\/2015-01-03\/sri-lankan-president-asks-tamils-to-re-elect-known-devil\/5998238\" target=\"_blank\">earlier this month<\/a> when he sought the support of the Tamil minority by asking them to vote for the &ldquo;devil you know&rdquo; over an &ldquo;unknown angel.&rdquo;)<\/p><div class=\"content-ad\" id=\"content-ad-3661134\"><\/div>\n<p>From the start, Sirisena took aim at Rajapaksa&#8217;s accumulation of power. &ldquo;One family has taken control of the economy, power and the party,&rdquo; he said <a href=\"/web/20150109094958/http://www.reuters.com\/%20article\/2014\/11\/21\/us-sri- lanka-election- idUSKCN0J50W520141121\" target=\"_blank\">when he defected<\/a>. &ldquo;The country is moving toward a dictatorship.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>Voters responded to his promise to reverse this trend and dismantle Rajapaksa&rsquo;s executive presidency.<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;This [result] shows that autocracy is not something that Sri Lankans will accept,&rdquo; Paikiasothy Saravanamuttu, executive director of the Center for Policy Alternatives, a Colombo-based think thank, told TIME after Rajapaksa conceded defeat in an early morning meeting with opposition leader Ranil Wickramasinghe.<\/p>\n<p>Congratulating the new Sri Lankan leader, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry <a href=\"/web/20150109094958/http://www.state.gov\/secretary\/remarks\/2015\/01\/235725.htm\" target=\"_blank\">said<\/a> he looked forward to working with Sirisena as his government &ldquo;works to implement its campaign platform of a Sri Lanka that is peaceful, inclusive, democratic, and prosperous.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>Kerry also commended Rajapaksa for conceding defeat following a largely peaceful ballot.<\/p>\n<p>Ahead of the vote, there were <a href=\"/web/20150109094958/http://www.theguardian.com\/world\/2015\/jan\/08\/fears-of-violence-as-polling-stations-open-in-sri-lanka-elections\" target=\"_blank\">fears of violence<\/a> as the country geared up for what looked like a close contest between the president and Sirisena. But with the opposition candidate clearly in the lead, the bloodshed did not materialize.<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;At the end of the day what clinched was the writing on the wall that there was a generalized desire for change and that any attempt to cling on to power wouldn&rsquo;t have support from within government itself,&rdquo; says Saravanamuttu.<\/p>\n<p>Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi was also quick to <a href=\"/web/20150109094958/https://twitter.com\/narendramodi\/status\/553393186815492096\" target=\"_blank\">congratulate<\/a> Sirisena.<\/p>\n<p>Under Rajapaksa, New Delhi had been left on the sidelines as Sri Lanka built stronger ties with China. Beijing <a href=\"/web/20150109094958/http://www.bloomberg.com\/news\/2015-01-06\/china-push-for-indian-ocean-influence-at-risk-as-sri-lanka-votes.html\" target=\"_blank\">stepped up<\/a> its economic involvement in the country, becoming a major investor investor and trading partner.

He didn&#8217;t expect to lose, but found himself vacating his residence after polls showed his challenger Maithripala Sirisena with over 51% of the vote, Reuters reported.<\/p>\n<p>Sirisena, a former minister in Rajapaksa&#8217;s government, defected to the opposition in November, and used his anticorruption stance as the cornerstone for his campaign.<\/p>\n<p>He pledged that his first act in office would be to weaken the very presidency that had allowed Rajapaksa to consolidate a huge amount of power, and reportedly plans to hold fresh parliamentary elections within 100 days of being sworn in.<\/p>\n<p>Rajapaksa was re-elected in 2010. He initially came to power in 2005, riding a wave of popularity after defeating the Tamil Tigers separatist group and ending the country&#8217;s violent civil war, but his administration was dogged by allegations of corruption and authoritarianism.<\/p>\n<p>Rajapaksa abolished the two-term limit on the presidency to allow himself to run for a third time, and then called Thursday&#8217;s snap elections two years before his second term ended &mdash; a move that backfired badly.<\/p>\n<p>The violence against opposition supporters that marred the lead-up to the polls was absent on Friday, as the outgoing President asked opposition leader Ranil Wickremesinghe to ensure a smooth handover of power.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;People need a change and this is a democracy,&#8221; a government official and

Beantown beat out San Francisco, Washington D.C., and Los Angeles in the Olympic sweepstakes. The latter&#8217;s loss is a mild surprise, considering LA&#8217;s Olympic experience: the city has hosted the Games twice, and has plenty of venues already built. Not that Boston has no Olympic attractions. Beach volleyball in Boston Common and field hockey at Harvard Stadium sound cool. The city is pretty compact. Hopefully they&#8217;ll find some use for Fenway Park. (Equestrian events? Yankees fans might appreciate horses crapping all over the outfield).<\/p>\n<p>The host city won&#8217;t be named until 2017, and Boston&#8217;s rival bidders potentially include Rome, Casablanca, Paris, Nairobi, Doha and Berlin. While many Bostonians are excited about the the prestige and emotional lift that an Olympic win would provide, critics &mdash; like members of the <a href=\"/web/20150109094958/http://www.nobostonolympics.org\/about\" target=\"_blank\">No Boston Olympics<\/a> opposition group &mdash; worry about the price tag. For good reason: academic research has consistently shown that for the host city, the Olympics aren&#8217;t the economic boon they&#8217;re cracked up to be. In fact, they do long-term harm.<\/p>\n<p>Cities consistently spend more than the original budget projections: before the London Olympics, Will Jennings, a professor of political science and public policy at the University of Southampton, found that the average <a href=\"/web/20150109094958/http://blogs.lse.ac.uk\/politicsandpolicy\/olympic-cost-overrun-jennings\/\" target=\"_blank\">cost overrun<\/a> for staging the Olympics was 200% since 1976. Boston has estimated that its bid would <a href=\"/web/20150109094958/http://www.masslive.com\/news\/boston\/index.ssf\/2014\/10\/boston_olympic_plans.html\" target=\"_blank\">cost<\/a> some $4.5 billion in private funding plus an additional $5 billion in regional infrastructure improvements. &#8220;That&#8217;s farcical,&#8221; says Andrew Zimbalist, a sports economist at Smith College, which is located some 80 miles west of Boston, and the author of the new book <em>Circus Maximus: The Economic Gamble Behind Hosting the Olympics and the World Cup. <\/em>Organizers in London, for example, initially said the Games would cost $4 billion. The final bill came out to to $15 to $20 billion.<\/p><div class=\"content-ad\" id=\"content-ad-3660945\"><\/div>\n<p>Zimbalist was surprised that Boston got the right to bid. The International Olympic Committee (IOC) just passed <a href=\"/web/20150109094958/http://www.dw.de\/ioc-agenda-2020-allows-olympics-in-different-host-countries\/a-18116022\" target=\"_blank\">reforms<\/a> seeking to control the spiraling costs of hosting the Games: he&#8217;s convinced that Los Angeles, with its existing Olympic infrastructure, made the most economic sense. Boston&#8217;s biggest challenge will be building an Olympic stadium to host the opening and closing ceremonies, as well as track and field. Zimbalist is also skeptical of Boston&#8217;s plan to utilize its many universities to host events and athletes in an Olympics village. It&#8217;s one thing for MIT to have fields for archery, and for other universities to have pools. It&#8217;s another to convert these places into full-fledged Olympic venues, with seating and infrastructure to support a flood of spectators.<\/p>\n<p>In his book, Zimbalist cites stacks of research showing that the Games aren&#8217;t worth it. The Olympics, cities are often told, will boost tourism. One econometric study, however, showed that when other factors were controlled for, Atlanta saw no statistically significant change in retail sales, hotel occupancy, or airport traffic during the 1996 Olympics. During the Beijing Olympics in August of 2008, hotel bed nights dropped 39% compared to the prior year. For the 2000 Sydney Olympics, two researchers concluded that &#8220;in terms of purely measurable economic variables the [Games] had a negative effect on New South Wales and Australia as a whole.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>During the Olympics, athletes, officials, media and fans often replace traditional tourists who are more likely to explore the city and spread the word about its virtues. Olympic tourists may brag about their swimming tickets in Boston. But jealous friends can&#8217;t then replicate that experience, cause the Olympics are over. So why go to Boston? The idea that the Olympics puts a city on a &#8220;world stage,&#8221; which will subsequently attract new investment and tourist dollars, in largely bunk.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;More often that not, Olympics wind up as a public burden,&#8221; says Zimbalist. &#8220;I have no reason to believe that Boston will be an exception rather than the rule.&#8221;<\/p><aside class=\"right-rail-module rr-ad\" data-name=\"rr-ad\"><div class=\"right-rail-ad\" id=\"right-rail-ad-3660945\"><\/div><\/aside><aside class=\"right-rail-module rr-share\" data-name=\"rr-share\"><span class=\"social-links\">\n    <a class=\"time-icons time-icons-mail social-link-mail\" href=\"mailto:?subject=Boston%20May%20Be%20the%20Next%20Olympic%20Sucker%20%7C%20TIME&body=Boston%20May%20Be%20the%20Next%20Olympic%20Sucker%0A%0ABoston%20will%20bid%20for%20the%202024%20Olympics.%20According%20to%20many%20economists%2C%20Beantown%20will%20regret%20it%20if%20it%20wins%0A%0Ahttp%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F3660945%2Fboston-olympics-2024%2F\" data-event=\"email\" title=\"Click to Email this article\"><\/a>\n    <a class=\"time-icons time-icons-fb social-link-fb popup\" href=\"/web/20150109094958/https://www.facebook.com\/sharer\/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F3660945%2Fboston-olympics-2024%2F\" data-event=\"fb-share\" title=\"Click to post this article to Facebook\"><\/a>\n    <a class=\"time-icons time-icons-tw social-link-tw popup\" href=\"#\" data-href=\"/web/20150109094958/https://twitter.com\/intent\/tweet?url=http%3A%2F%2Fti.me%2F1AuXQKo&text=If%20Boston%20wins%20its%202024%20Olympics%20bid%2C%20it%20may%20sorely%20regret%20it&via=TIME\" data-event=\"tweet\" title=\"Click to Tweet this article\"><\/a>\n    <a class=\"time-icons time-icons-linkedin social-link-linkedin popup\" href=\"/web/20150109094958/http://www.linkedin.com\/shareArticle?mini=true&url=http%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F3660945%2Fboston-olympics-2024%2F&title=Boston+May+Be+the+Next+Olympic+Sucker\" data-event=\"linkedin\" title=\"Click to post this article to LinkedIn\"><\/a>\n    <a href=\"#\" class=\"time-icons time-icons-comment livefyre-commentcount toggle-comments\" data-lf-site-id=\"314099\" data-lf-article-id=\"3660945\" data-url=\"/web/20150109094958/http://time.com\/3660945\/boston-olympics-2024\/\" data-title=\"Boston May Be the Next Olympic Sucker\" title=\"Click to view and post comments\" data-event=\"comment-click\">0<\/a>\n<\/span>\n<\/aside>","read_more":true,"section":{"name":"Sports","slug":"sports","url":"/web/20150109094958/http://time.com\/sports\/","description":"Where sports is on the mind.
