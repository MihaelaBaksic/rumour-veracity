''Charlie Hebdo'' ({{IPA-fr|ʃaʁli ɛbdo}}; French for ''Weekly Charlie'') is a [[List of satirical magazines|satirical weekly newspaper]] in France that features cartoons, reports, [[polemic]]s and jokes.

The magazine was first published from 1969 to 1981. It folded, but was resurrected in 1992.{{citation needed}}

The magazine, which has a history of attracting controversy, was unsuccessfully sued in 2006 by Islamic organizations for having published the [[Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons controversy|''Jyllands-Posten'' Muhammad cartoons]]. The cover of a 2011 issue, dubbed "''Charia'' ''Hebdo''" (a pun on [[Sharia]] law), depicted a cartoon of the Islamic prophet [[Muhammad]].<ref name="bbc-15550350">{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-15550350|title=BBC News: Attack on French satirical paper Charlie Hebdo (2 November 2011)|publisher=BBC|date=2 November 2011|accessdate=21 December 2011}}</ref> The newspaper's office, at the time in the [[20th arrondissement of Paris|20th arrondissement]], was fire-bombed<ref name=FT01>{{cite news|last=Boxel|first=James|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/75f87b24-0541-11e1-a3d1-00144feabdc0.html|title=Firebomb attack on satirical French magazine|newspaper=Financial Times |date=2 November 2011 |accessdate=19 September 2012 |registration=yes}}</ref> and its website [[Hacker (computer security)|hacked]].{{citation needed|date=January 2015}} Religion was a primary target of the magazine, and two years before the attack, ''Charlie Hebdo'' cartoonist [[Charb|Stéphane "Charb" Charbonnier]] stated, "We have to carry on until Islam has been rendered as banal as Catholicism."<ref name="CBC 8 January 2015"/>

On the day of the attack, the cover of ''Charlie Hebdo'' depicted a caricature of [[Michel Houellebecq]], whose latest book, ''[[Soumission]]'', is a novel which depicts France in 2022, when a Muslim man is elected as President of France.

=== Motive ===
Hatred for ''Charlie Hebdo''{{'}}s cartoons, which made jokes about Islamic leaders as well as Muhammad, is perceived to be the main motive for the massacre. Former deputy director of the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]], [[Michael&nbsp;J. Morell]], proposed that the motive of the attackers was "[a]bsolutely clear: trying to shut down a media organization that lampooned the Prophet Muhammad".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/08/world/europe/charlie-hebdo-paris-shooting.html?_r=0|title=Terrorists Strike Charlie Hebdo Newspaper in Paris, Leaving 12 Dead|date=7 January 2015|work=NYTimes.com|accessdate=8 January 2015}}</ref>

In March 2013, Al-Qaeda's branch in Yemen, commonly known as [[Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula]] (AQAP), released a hit list in an edition of their English-language magazine ''[[Inspire (magazine)|Inspire]]''. The list included [[Charb|Stéphane Charbonnier]] and others whom AQAP accused of insulting Islam.<ref>{{cite web

On 7 January 2015, ''Charlie Hebdo'' tweeted a cartoon of [[Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi]], leader of the [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant]] (ISIL). The sarcastic cartoon offers best wishes to Al-Baghdadi; he replies, "And especially good health." The cartoon is signed "HONORE", signifying the cartoon was drawn by Philippe Honoré, who died in the attack later that day. It was ''Charlie Hebdo''{{'}}s final tweet before the massacre.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-trending-30714297|title=Charlie Hebdo's mysterious last tweet before attack|date=7 January 2015|work=BBC.comm|accessdate=8 January 2015}}</ref>.

==== Police officer shooting ====

A police officer, Clarissa Jean-Philippe, was shot and killed in a southern suburb of Paris on Thursday. The suspect Ahmedi Koulibali is from the same jihadist group as the ones that carried out the Charlie Hebdo attack, and French police have said there is a "connection" between them. The following day an armed gunman, suspected to be Ahmedi Koulibali, attacked a kasher supermarket in Paris, taking one hostage.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.haaretz.com/news/world/1.636178|title=Paris shooting updates / Charlie Hebdo attackers take hostage after car chase|date=9 January 2015|work=Haaretz.com}}</ref><ref name=BBCOP2LIVE/>

=== Manhunt ===
At 10:30 CET on 8 January, the day following the attack, the two suspects were said to have been spotted in [[Aisne]], north-east of Paris.<ref name="BBC News"/> Armed security forces, including the [[National Gendarmerie Intervention Group]] (GIGN) and the [[Force d'intervention de la police nationale]] (FIPN), were deployed to the department to search for the suspects.<ref name="guardian_policeop"/><ref name="france3-regions.francetvinfo.fr"/>
