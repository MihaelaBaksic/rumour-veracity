== Background ==
{{Main|Charlie Hebdo}}
''Charlie Hebdo'' ({{IPA-fr|ʃaʁli ɛbdo}}; French for ''Weekly Charlie'') is a French [[List of satirical magazines|satirical weekly newspaper]], featuring cartoons, reports, polemics, and jokes. Irreverent and stridently non-conformist in tone, the publication is strongly [[antireligious]]<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.lemonde.fr/idees/article/2013/11/20/non-charlie-hebdo-n-est-pas-raciste_3516646_3232.html | title=Non, "Charlie Hebdo" n'est pas raciste ! | work=[[Le Monde]] | accessdate=4 March 2014 | author=Charb}}</ref> and left-wing, publishing articles about the extreme right, Catholicism, Islam, Judaism, politics, and culture, among other issues.

''Charlie Hebdo'' was first published from 1969 to 1981.  It folded, but was resurrected in 1992. Cartoonist [[Charb|Stéphane "Charb" Charbonnier]] was the [[editor-in-chief]] from 2009 until his death in this shooting.

''Charlie Hebdo'', which has a history of attracting controversy, was unsuccessfully sued in 2006 by Islamic organizations, for having published the [[Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons controversy|Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons]]. The cover of a 2011 issue, dubbed "[[Sharia|''Charia'']] ''Hebdo''", depicted a cartoon of the Islamic prophet [[Muhammed]].<ref name="bbc-15550350">{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-15550350 |title=BBC News: Attack on French satirical paper Charlie Hebdo (2 November 2011) |publisher=BBC |date=2 November 2011 |accessdate=21 December 2011}}</ref> The newspaper's office, at the time in the [[20th arrondissement of Paris|20th arrondissement]], was fire-bombed<ref name=FT01>{{cite news |last=Boxel |first=James |url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/75f87b24-0541-11e1-a3d1-00144feabdc0.html |title=Firebomb attack on satirical French magazine |newspaper=Financial Times |date= 2 November 2011 |accessdate= 19 September 2012}}</ref> and its website [[Hacker (computer security)|hacked]].

[[Anne Hidalgo]], attending a rally in the [[Place de la République]] in the wake of the shooting, said, "What we saw today was an attack on the values of our republic, Paris is a peaceful place.
