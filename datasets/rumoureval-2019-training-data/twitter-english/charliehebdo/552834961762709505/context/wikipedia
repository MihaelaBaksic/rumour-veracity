==Background==
{{main|Charlie Hebdo}}
''Charlie Hebdo'' ({{IPA-fr|ʃaʁli ɛbdo}}; [[French language|French]] for ''Charlie Weekly'') is a French [[satirical]] weekly newspaper, featuring cartoons, reports, polemics and jokes. Irreverent and stridently non-conformist in tone, the publication is strongly [[antireligious]]<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.lemonde.fr/idees/article/2013/11/20/non-charlie-hebdo-n-est-pas-raciste_3516646_3232.html | title=Non, "Charlie Hebdo" n’est pas raciste ! | publisher=[[Le Monde]] | accessdate=4 March 2014 | author=Charb}}</ref> and [[Left-wing politics|left-wing]], publishing articles on the extreme right, Catholicism, Islam, Judaism, politics, and culture, among other issues.

It first appeared from 1969 to 1981; it folded, but was resurrected in 1992. [[Charb|Stéphane "Charb" Charbonnier]] had been the editor since 2012 until his death in this shooting.

The publication has been controversial in the past. The cover of a 2011 issue, dubbed "[[Sharia|''Charia'']] ''Hebdo''", depicted a cartoon of the Islamic prophet [[Muhammed]],<ref name="bbc-15550350">{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-15550350 |title=BBC News: Attack on French satirical paper Charlie Hebdo (November 2, 2011) |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date=2 November 2011 |accessdate=21 December 2011}}</ref> prompting the newspaper's office in the [[20th arrondissement of Paris|20th arrondissement]] to be fire-bombed<ref name=FT01>{{cite news |last=Boxel |first=James |url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/75f87b24-0541-11e1-a3d1-00144feabdc0.html |title=Firebomb attack on satirical French magazine |newspaper=Financial Times |date= 2 November 2011 <!-- 12:06 pm -->  |accessdate= 19 September 2012}}</ref> and its website [[Hacker (computer security)|hacked]].
