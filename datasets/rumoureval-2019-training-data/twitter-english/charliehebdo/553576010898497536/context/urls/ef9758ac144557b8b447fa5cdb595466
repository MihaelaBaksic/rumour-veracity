          <p>PARISâAhmed Merabet, the 40-year-old policeman whose killing was caught on video, is emerging from the attack on the Charlie Hebdo magazine as a heroic figure.</p>
<p>Mr. Merabet, a Frenchman who many assume is a Muslim based on his name, died at the hands of terrorists targeting a satirical magazine because of its frequent lampooning of Islam.</p>
<p>His ethnic origins and religious faith are helping to define his legacy, even as they remain difficult to confirm.</p>
<p>A Paris police representative gave no details about Mr. Merabet, saying the family doesnât want the media attention. The police union that represents him wouldnât comment on his religion, as Franceâs government institutions are staunchly secular.</p>
<p>Calls to his sister werenât returned. An attempt via social media to reach a woman who described herself as his cousin wasnât successful.</p>
<p>On the social-media site Twitter, the hashtag #JeSuisAhmedâor I am Ahmedâwas gaining popularity as an homage to the slain officer.</p>
<p>Mr. Merabet was one of three policemen who drove to the scene of the attack in Paris on Wednesday in an attempt to block the gunmen who were fleeing the magazine offices. He got out of the car and approached the suspects. He drew his gun and shot at the gunmen, then was injured in the lower abdomen in the ensuing firefight.</p>
<p>In a chilling video taken by an observer from a nearby rooftop, one of the gunmen walked toward the injured Mr. Merabet, who was reeling on the ground.</p>
<p>âYou wanted to kill us,â said the masked gunman.</p>
<p>âNo, weâre good, boss,â replied Mr. Merabet, raising his hands to show he wasnât holding a weapon. The gunman then shot Mr. Merabet in the head at close range before fleeing with his accomplice in a car. Mr. Merabet was one of 12 victims of the attack.</p>
<p>Mr. Merabet lived in Livry-Gargan, a quiet suburb northeast of Paris, in a house very close to his sisterâs apartment, neighbors said. He was single, never married, and had no children.</p>
<p>The Merabets came from an Algerian family, but grew up in the Paris region, said Chantal Ribiero, who has lived for several years in the same building as Mr. Merabetâs sister, Nabiha, a nurse.</p>
<p>âI only met him once or twice, but he was always very friendly,â said Ms. Ribiero, 58.</p>
<p>Rocco Contento, a spokesman for Unite SGP police union who considered Mr. Merabet âa very good friend,â said the police officer worked in the 11th arrondissement for the past eight years and served as a union steward for a few years.</p>
<p>âHe was always smiling, talked little, always listened, but always was first to help,â said Mr. Contento. âI saw the video and I was very shocked,â he added. âI was overcome with emotion. It was an execution. He was helpless on the ground. To die in this manner is so horrible.âHe added, âHe was a very good, very courageous policeman. He deserves to be honored.â</p>

        <div class="stri-full">
          <p>PARISâOne of the French-born brothers who allegedly stormed the newsroom of the satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo in the deadly rampage that left 12 dead is believed by U.S. and French intelligence to have received weapons training from an al Qaeda offshoot in Yemen, U.S. officials said Thursday.</p>
<p>The brother, Said Kouachi, was allegedly trained under the auspices of al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula during 2011, the officials said, but there is so far no evidence the group directed, ordered or monitored the attack.</p>
<p>âWe know they were inspired,â another U.S. official said, âbut we do not know the extent they were associated with al Qaeda.â</p>
<p>French Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve said Thursday that the man, 34 years old, was identified from video footage captured by neighbors during the Wednesday attack. A French national identity card with his name was found in an abandoned getaway car, he said. The ID card led investigators to the court files of his younger brother, ChÃ©rif Kouachi.</p>
<p>Authorities first focused their attention on ChÃ©rif Kouachi, who has a previous terror-related conviction. Said Kouachi has no criminal record.</p>
<p>The Kouachi brothers were still at large late Thursday, as the manhunt for Franceâs most wanted men led elite police forces north of Paris, where two men resembling the suspects were seen near the town of Villers-CotterÃªts.</p>
<p>Current and former officials said the tactical prowess demonstrated in the attack showed the gunmen had received training and rehearsed before Wednesday.</p>
<p>âThe attack was very complex. It was obviously less complex than 9/11 but it was tactically complex, that required planning, reconnaissance, logistics and support from above,â said Michael Flynn, a retired lieutenant general and former head of the Defense Intelligence Agency. âThey clearly rehearsed this attack.â</p>
<p>Mr. Flynn said the attack appeared to have the strategic impact that many al Qaeda affiliates seek. âWhat they wanted is international condemnation. It is counterintuitive to us, but it makes perfect sense to them. That is what makes them heroes,â he said.</p>
<p>ChÃ©rif Kouachi, 32 years old, was listed on a U.S. list of known or suspected terrorists, as well as on the U.S. governmentâs no-fly list, according to a senior U.S. intelligence official. He turned to radical Islam after he began attending a mosque in Paris where Muslim preacher Farid Benyettou espoused the militant Salafi jihadist ideology of al Qaeda, according to Vincent Ollivier and other lawyers involved in a court case against him.</p>
<p>In 2004, ChÃ©rif Kouachi joined others who were allegedly preparing to fight U.S. troops in Iraq, according to French prosecutors. At the time, dozens of French citizens had gone to Iraq, often via Syria, to fight American troops at the behest of radical Islamist preachers who accused the U.S. of invading Iraq. It was unclear if he received any military training, prosecutors said, but the cell mastered the logistics of sending recruits to the battlefield.</p>
<p>Once in Iraq, several French jihadists associated with Mr. Benyettou, ChÃ©rif Kouachiâs preacher, trained in camps linked to the most aggressive of the Iraqi insurgency groups, al Qaeda in Iraq. The group launched suicide attacks against U.S. troops and their allies in 2004 and 2005 around Baghdad and Fallujah, U.S. officials said.</p>
<p>ChÃ©rif Kouachi planned to travel to Iraq but never got the chance, according to French prosecutors. In early 2005, French police swooped in on the recruiting cell, detaining several people, including him and Mr. Benyettou.</p>
<p>Asked by investigators why he had booked a flight to Damascusâa common gateway to Iraq at the timeâChÃ©rif Kouachi said his mentor had convinced him that âto die a martyr is a good thing,â according to a French magistrate familiar with the investigation.</p>
<p>ChÃ©rif Kouachiâs lawyer, Mr. Ollivier, said the motive was peer pressure. âWhen I met him after he was questioned, Mr. Kouachi seemed relieved,â Mr. Ollivier said. âHe didnât really want to go but was scared he would be branded as a coward.â</p>
<p>ChÃ©rif Kouachi was sentenced to 18 months in prison in 2008 for belonging to a terror group.</p>
<p>French antiterrorism investigators in 2010 suspected ChÃ©rif Kouachi was plotting to help a convicted terrorist escape from prison, authorities said.</p>
<p>He was detained for months, but prosecutors said they lacked evidence to keep him. He appeared to be only a married man who worked as a fishmonger at a supermarket, having apparently turned the page on his past, according to the magistrate familiar with the matter. Prosecutors were mindful of his radical beliefs, the magistrate said, but lacked incriminating information to elevate his terror-alert status.</p>
<p>The failure to identify ChÃ©rif Kouachi as a looming national security threat  highlights a daunting challenge to French authorities: How to keep tabs on scores of disaffected youth in one of Europeâs biggest Muslim communities.</p>
<p>âPolice cannot keep track of myriad people round the clock, especially if they appear to have gotten back in the fold,â said Christian Prouteau, founder and former head of the GIGN, an elite police unit that reports to the Defense Ministry.</p>
<p>Born in Paris, the Kouachi brothers were separated from their parents of Algerian origin, authorities said, growing up in a childrenâs home in Brittany. Little is known about their early lives or why they werenât raised by their parents.</p>
<p>During the early 2000s, ChÃ©rif Kouachi displayed no signs of religious fervor, said Mr. Ollivier, the lawyer who had earlier assisted the man. His former client worked as a pizza-delivery boy, listened to rap music and went to parties.</p>
<p>In a 2005 TV documentary about French jihadists, a social worker said he exchanged letters with ChÃ©rif Kouachi while in prison and was persuaded the inmate believed he had taken a wrong turn by linking up with radicals.</p>
<p>âHe realized that heâd been conned and swept into a situation that he wasnât in control of,â Yann Bourhis, the social worker, said in the documentary. Mr. Bourhis didnât return calls for comment.</p>
<p>In 2008, a French court convicted ChÃ©rif Kouachi and Mr. Benyettou on the terror charges. Mr. Kouachi was given credit for time served.</p>
<p>During trial, Mr. Benyettou denied operating a recruitment cell, saying he had only âenlightened friends on religion,â according to Christophe Grignard, a lawyer who defended him.</p>
<p>During Wednesdayâs attack, one of the gunmen shouted, according to video footage captured by neighbors: âWe have avenged Prophet Muhammad, we have killed Charlie Hebdo.â</p>
<p>On Thursday, Mr. Cazeneuve, the French Interior Minister, said the brothers had been under watch in recent years but they hadnât raised any suspicions.</p>
<p>âNo element that could have led to the launch of a judicial probe had come to our attention,â the minister said.</p>

        <div class="stri-full">
          <p>The revelation that a suspect in the Paris terror attack received weaponâs training in Yemen deepens fears among intelligence officials that an al Qaeda affiliate with a long and deadly track record still represents a major terror threat.</p>
<p>The al Qaeda threat seemed dwarfed in recent months by warnings from Western intelligence agencies that their citizens who have flocked to fight alongside the extremist group Islamic State would return radicalized and ready to sow terror back in their home countries.</p>
<p>Islamic State also has launched a multipronged ideological and propaganda campaign aimed at dislodging al Qaeda as the dominant jihadist organization.</p>
<p>Despite Islamic Stateâs barbarity in battles to control portions of Syria and Iraq, al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, or AQAP, has successfully launched audacious and technologically sophisticated attacks against Americans and their allies in their own homelands.</p>
<p>Long before Islamic State coalesced into a global force, AQAP was known, and feared, by Western intelligence officials for its ability to attract and groom foreign-born Muslims for attacks via slick English manuals and the late American-born preacher Anwar al-Awlaki.</p>
<p>These attacks included the failed U.S.-bound airline bomb threat from Christmas 2009 and the Fort Hood terror attack in November 2009 in which a radicalized U.S. Army officer killed 13 people.</p>
<p>The head of the U.K.âs domestic intelligence agency reiterated on Thursday how seriously he and other intelligence agencies view al Qaeda, saying the groupâs affiliates continue to pose an immediate threat and are planning large-scale attacks against the West.</p>
<p>In a rare public speech, MI5 chief Andrew Parker said âa core group of al Qaeda terrorists in Syria is planning mass casualty attacks against the West.â</p>
<p>U.S. officials said they believe Said Kouachiâa suspect in the Paris attackâtrained in Yemen in 2011 under AQAPâs auspices, though they were still assembling information on more precise dates. French intelligence also made a similar assessment and shared it with American officials, said a U.S. official.</p>
<p>A Yemeni official said that his government couldnât confirm exact dates that Mr. Kouachi was in his country.</p>
<p>AQAP hasnât issued any formal statement since the Wednesday shooting, and the suspectsâMr. Kouachi and his brother ChÃ©rifâare still at large.</p>
<p>In the past, however, AQAP has proved capable of training foot soldiers in military combat and providing them with technical know-how to sink an American naval cruiser, escape Western airport surveillance and almost assassinate the leading Saudi Arabian counterterrorism official. After the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks in the U.S., al Qaedaâs offshoot in Yemen became the groupâs most active offshoot.</p>
<p>Led by Yemeni Nasir al Wahishi, Osama bin Ladenâs former secretary in Afghanistan, the group combined jihadists in Saudi and Yemen, bin Ladenâs ancestral homeland, into a terror juggernaut.</p>
<p>Yemeni members became adept at adapting their message for Western audiences and building sophisticated bombs. Its slick online English-language magazine, âInspire,â offered advice and instruction for would-be bombers and delivered the message that al Qaeda adherents didnât need to travel to a distant Muslim land for training. They could act unilaterally from home.</p>
<p>By the late 2000s, Yemen had become a magnet for would-be foreign jihadists seeking to hone a deadly craft. Western Muslims would often enter the country on student visas, telling authorities that they wanted to study Arabic at some of Yemenâs renowned language schools.</p>
<p>By 2011, however, with stepped up U.S. surveillance against AQAP and Mr. Awlaki, Yemen tightened its visa standards and it became more difficult for foreigners to achieve residency there. A U.S. drone strike killed Mr. Awlaki in September 2009.</p>
<p>His death didn&#8217;t stop AQAPâs recruitment efforts. A recent edition of âInspireâ listed Charlie Hebdoâs top editor, StÃ©phane Charbonnier among a hit list of targets that the AQAP editors accused of insulting the Muslim faith.</p>

        <div class="stri-full">
          <p>Europeâs ascendant anti-immigration and nationalist movements tried to capitalize on a deadly attack in Paris this week to trumpet a theme they have pressed for years, but rarely before with this much urgency: a loss of cultural identity.</p>
<p>âThis bloodshed shows that anyone who ignored or laughed off the concerns about the threat Islamism poses is a fool,â said Alexander Gauland, a leader of Alternative for Germany, an upstart party that wants to limit immigration and take Germany out of the euro.</p>
<p>In the past, such rhetoric would be quickly dismissed as the ramblings of the political fringe. But these parties, from France to the Netherlands to the U.K., have been on the march in the recent years, fueled by growing public discontent over a sense among many Europeans that their traditional way of life is threatened.</p>
<p>Europeâs persistent economic woes and the growingâand oft-resentedâinfluence of the European Union in national affairs have provided an opening to these movements, which critics say prey on their citizenâs basest fears. These groups have long targeted Islam, whose growing presence on the continent they say threatens Europeâs cultural mores.</p>
<p>The radicalization of a generation of dispossessed Muslims in Middle Eastern wars in Iraq and Syria has only deepened fears, helping these parties to score their best showing ever in Mayâs European Parliamentary vote.</p>
<p>âWestern governments have to realize that we are at war,â said Geert Wilders, the leader of the Netherlandsâ Party for Freedom.</p>
<p>Europeâs establishment parties worry that the attack provides the nationalists more ammunition to sow xenophobia. Those tensions bubbled to surface in France on Thursday.</p>
<p>Marine Le Pen, the French leader of the National Front, the party which finished first in last yearâs European elections with 25% of the vote, claimed her party had been excluded from a march of unity with other political groups on Sunday. âBelieve me, this will be a stain on the French political class,â said Ms. Le Pen, who will nevertheless meet with French President FranÃ§ois Hollande on Friday at the ÃlysÃ©e Palace.</p>
<p>âThe National Front has one foot in the Republic, one outside of it,â Socialist Party spokesman Carlos de Silva said on BFM TV television channel. âThe National Front is not welcome at this march, which aims to defend something that National Front is not.â</p>
<p>Tensions rose further when Bernard Monot, a European member of Parliament for the Front, said in a message on a Twitter account registered to his name that the rally without the Front would be âthe club of those responsible for Islamist terrorism in France.â</p>
<p>The tit-for-tat over the march reveals the deeper difficulty Mr. Hollande faces in negotiating rising tensions in French society over immigration and identity. With opinion polls showing his popularity at a record low for any French president, he is under pressure on many fronts. The economy is barely growing and Mr. Hollande has failed to meet promises to repair France finances and bring down unemployment.</p>
<p>Fears of terror were on the rise even before the Wednesday attack on the French magazine Charlie Hebdo that killed 12 people. A new survey of 1,005 people by polling company Ifop showed 80% of French people thought there was a high terrorist threat in France, the highest ever since the poll began after the Sept. 11 attacks in the U.S. in 2001.</p>
<p>âI donât think it will be long before Le Pen reverts to type and strikes an âI told you soâ posture, accusing not just this government but past governments for their failure to manage immigration or recognize its dangers,â said James Shields, professor of French politics at Aston University and author of books about the far-right in France.</p>
<p>French people will be looking for a strong reaction from their leader, analysts say.</p>
<p>âMr. Hollande has to show there can be no doubt over the terrorist attack,â said Jerome Fourquet, an analyst at Ifop.</p>
<p>Mr. Hollande has already been tested by clashes between groups in French society. In July last year, his government took the confrontational step of banning pro-Palestinian groups from holding a rally in Paris after earlier marches were marred by violent clashes near synagogues.</p>
<p>The attack in France on Wednesday came at a particularly sensitive moment for Germany, where growing weekly anti-Islam demonstrations in the eastern city of Dresden have roiled the nation over the past month.</p>
<p>The demonstrations, organized by a group calling itself Patriotic Europeans Against the Islamization of the West, have been repeatedly dismissed as xenophobic across the mainstream political spectrum. But they have kept growing, reaching 18,000 people on Monday and spawning similar protests in other cities.</p>
<p>Now the Paris tragedy has given the group, known by its German initials as Pegida, an opportunity to claim vindication.</p>
<p>âIslamistsâ¦have shown today in France that they are not capable of democracy, but seek solutions via violence and death,â the group said. âBut our politicians want us to think the opposite.â</p>
<p>It invited protesters at the next demonstration, scheduled for next Monday, to wear mourning ribbons in memory of the Parisian victims.</p>
<p>Germanyâs upstart populist party, Alternative for Germany, has also seized on the attacks as justification for its demands for overhauling immigration, and is testing a closer alliance with Pegida.</p>
<p>âThe massacre of Paris also shows how fragile and in need of protection the core values of our society are,â said Mr. Gauland of Alternative for Germany.</p>
<p>German officials are struggling with how to respond. The normally soft-spoken chancellor, Angela Merkel, condemned the protests in unusually strong terms in her New Yearâs address and has continued to call for tolerance.</p>
<p>âWe have a very good relationship with the great majority of Muslims in Germany,â Ms. Merkel said Thursday.</p>
<p>But a new study released on Thursday of German attitudes toward Islam showed the reality was more complicated. The Bertelsmann Stiftung, a German foundation, found that the share of non-Muslim Germans who viewed Islam as incompatible with the Western world rose to 61% in November 2014 from 52% in 2012.</p>
<p>In the U.K., Nigel Farage, the head of the small but fast-growing U.K. Independence Party, said the attacks called into question the multiculturalism in some European countries. UKIP has recently been gaining support in Britain with its anti-EU and tough-on-immigration message, including recently wooing two lawmakers from Prime Minister David Cameronâs Conservative Party.</p>
<p>Speaking on Britainâs LBC radio on Thursday, Mr. Farage said Britain and some other countries âhave a really rather gross policy of multiculturalism,â by encouraging âpeople from other cultures to remain within those cultures and not integrate fully within our communities.â</p>
<p>Mr. Cameron responded by saying it wasnât the time to be scoring political points. âToday is the day to stand full square behind the French people after this appalling outrage and simply to say that we will do everything we can to help them hunt down and find the people who did this,â Mr. Cameron told news media. âThe cause of this terrorism is the terrorists themselves.â</p>

        <div class="stri-full">
          <p>Several European countries bolstered security measures as Wednesdayâs shooting in Paris reinforced long-held worries about the threat of gun-wielding attackers.</p>
<p>European security and intelligence officials said people who act alone or in small groups and sow carnage with guns are among the biggest threats to emerge from the current wave of Islamic extremism. That is because such attacks are easier to organize than a large-scale bombing plot and will typically involve less communication within terror networks that intelligence agents can intercept.</p>
<p>The attack âis a terrible reminder of the intentions of those who wish to harm us,â Andrew Parker, the head of the U.K.âs domestic intelligence service, MI5, said in a speech on Thursday at the agencyâs London headquarters.</p>
<p>Mr. Parker cited in particular the threat from al Qaeda, saying âa group of core al Qaeda terrorists in Syria is planning mass casualty attacks against the West.â He didnât elaborate on how advanced such planning was.</p>
<p>Since the Paris attack, French authorities have deployed more than a thousand additional police and paramilitary forces across the greater metropolitan area of Paris, standing guard at department stores, newsrooms and religious sites. The streets around the presidentâs official residence, the ÃlysÃ©e Palace, were locked down. The government also raised the alert level in the Picardie region in Northern France, where police were hunting for the alleged gunmen.</p>
<p>In Washington, officials said that Attorney General Eric Holder would travel to Paris this weekend for high-level meetings on terrorism. Mr. Holder will attend a meeting of European officials led by the French minister of the interior, aides said, and the talks will center on terror threats, the security risks of people returning from foreign battlefieldsâsuch as Syriaâand countering homegrown violent extremism.</p>
<p>The U.K. said on Thursday that it had boosted security at border crossings, including more searches of vehicles and passengers and scanning of freight. It also increased the visible security presence at a number of border locations, such as the French port of Calais, the Eurostar train terminal in Parisâs Gare du Nord station and several U.K. ports.</p>
<p>The U.K.âs Home Secretary Theresa May described the countryâs additional security measures as precautionary.</p>
<p>Ms. May made the statement shortly after leading an hourlong meeting of top security and intelligence officials to consider Britainâs response and its own preparedness for such an attack. She said there had been no change to the already-heightened threat level in the U.K.</p>
<p>Germanyâs interior minister said the country had boosted security measures and was paying special attention to journalistic and French government buildings. On Thursday morning, police vans were stationed outside two Berlin newspapers that had printed some of the Charlie Hebdo cartoons.</p>
<p>British and German officials said the measures werenât in response to a specific threat.</p>
<p>In Belgium, authorities increased surveillance of some organizations, without specifying which groups or locations. On Thursday, the countryâs highest ranking counterterrorism official in the Netherlands met with the Dutch association of chief editors and the union that represents the countryâs journalists to discuss security issues.</p>
<p>Security specialists say the style of the attack in Paris showed a degree of tactical sophistication unseen in recent attacks on Western targets. Some said the operation suggested the masked gunmen likely had military training, raising concerns about the risk of people who have trained with extremist organizations overseas returning to the West to launch attacks.</p>
<p>The commando-style attack in Mumbai in 2008, in which more than 160 people were killed, raised the specter of similar attacks on European soil. In 2010, German authorities stepped up their security measures after they and their counterparts in France and the U.K. warned of possible commando-style attacks in Europe.</p>
<p>Some countries have beefed up their ability to respond to such threats in recent years, such as putting together a central domestic weapons registry that police can access quickly and investing in more powerful assault rifles and training. French authorities have stepped up police presence around government buildings, tourist sites and other sensitive locations following the countryâs 2013 military intervention in Mali and its involvement in airstrikes against Islamic State operations in Iraq.</p>
<p>Still, gun attacks remain difficult to prevent. In 2012, a French petty criminal swearing fealty to al Qaeda, allegedly killed three Jewish schoolchildren, a rabbi and three French soldiers in shootings in and around Toulouse. Last year, a gunman killed four people at the Jewish Museum of Belgium in Brussels. Recent months have also seen extremist-inspired shootings in Canada and Australia.</p>
<p>âA single perpetrator who takes a weapon and shoots people he sees as hereticsâthat to me is not just imaginable, it is likely,â said Torsten Voss, head of the Hamburg office of Germanyâs domestic intelligence agency, during an interview with The Wall Street Journal in September.</p>
<p>Concerns in recent months led British authorities in November to publish guidance on what people should do in the event of a gun attack. It advises that in the event of a gun attack people should take cover and then leave as soon as possible.</p>
<p>If unable to escape, âyou should consider locking yourself and others in a room or cupboard,â the detailed guidance says. âBarricade the door, then stay away from it. If possible, choose a room where escape or further movement is possible. Silence any sources of noise, such as mobile phones.â</p>

          <p>WASHINGTONâPresident Barack Obama made an unannounced visit to the French embassy in Washington, D.C. on Thursday to sign a condolence book for the victims of a deadly attack this week against the staff of Paris magazine.</p>
<p>Mr. Obama stood in silence for a moment before shaking hands with Gerard Araud, the French ambassador to the U.S.</p>
<p>In the condolence book, Mr. Obama wrote: âOn behalf of all Americans, I extend our deepest sympathy and solidarity to the people of France following the terrible terrorist attack in Paris. As allies across the centuries, we stand united with our French brothers to ensure that justice is done and our way of life is defended. We go forward together knowing that terror is no match for freedom and ideals we stand for&#8211;ideals that light the world. Vive la France!â</p>
<p>Gunmen stormed the offices of the provocative French magazine Charlie Hebdo on Wednesday, in apparent retaliation for the publicationâs long history of lampooning the founder of Islam.</p>
<p>Mr. Obama denounced the attacks this week, saying they show âthe degree to which these terrorists fear freedom of speech and freedom of the press.â</p>
<p>The White House also said that Mr. Obama will receive a review on Thursday of terror threat information, adding that the Department of Homeland Security has no indications about current threats to the U.S.</p>

          <p>PARISâThe bloody <a href="">attack on French magazine Charlie Hebdo</a> killed 12, including some of the countryâs sharpest satirical cartoonists and a police officer trying to come to their aid.</p>
<p>People around the world observed a minute of silence Thursday to mourn the victims and show solidarity with the principle of freedom of the press, as police continued to hunt for the alleged perpetrators.</p>
<p>StÃ©phane Charbonnier, 47 years old, was Charlie Hebdoâs publisher. He had recently become one of the primary targets of critics in the controversy over the magazineâs irreverent take on religion.</p>
<p>Mr. Charbonnier, who signed his drawings as Charb, had been under special police protection since receiving a death threat in 2012, when Charlie Hebdo published a series of drawings of the Prophet Muhammad. He repeatedly defended the magazineâs decision to publish such drawings and remained undeterred by threats.</p>
<p>âI have no kids, no wife, no car, no loans,â Mr. Charbonnier told French newspaper Le Monde in 2012. âIt may sound a little pompous, but I prefer to die standing up than live on my knees.â</p>
<p>Mr. Charbonnier drew for publications including leftist LâHumanitÃ© and another satirical magazine, Fluide Glacial. But Charlie Hebdo was his main arena.</p>
<p>In the most recent edition of the magazine, released on Jan. 7, Mr. Charbonnier drew a foreboding cartoon: Under the headline âStill no attacks in France,â a jihadist carrying an AK-47 says, âWait! Weâve until the end of January to present our wishes.â</p>
<p>âMy partner died because he drew in a newspaper,â Mr. Charbonnierâs girlfriend, Jeannette Bougrab, who served as secretary of state in charge of youth issues under former President Nicolas Sarkozy, said on French TV. âI would like for someone to explain to me what happened in France.â</p>
<p>Georges Wolinksi, 80, is described by many as one of the most provocative of Franceâs political satirists.</p>
<p>Born in Tunisia, he was the son of a Polish immigrant and a Franco-Italian mother. After some early publishing successes, his career took off at a predecessor magazine to Charlie Hebdo called LâHebdo Hara-Kiri.</p>
<p>He drew for most major French publications, published close to a hundred books of drawings and also wrote plays and movie scripts and copy for some famous advertisements. He is best known for his burlesque drawings of women and sex.</p>
<p>Mr. Wolinski was married to Maryse Wolinski, a journalist, for more than 40 years. His daughter Elsa, also a journalist, described her father as a very âmelancholic and sometimes pessimisticâ man who went all in, in his fight for his liberty.</p>
<p>âI was raised with the idea that he was doing a job with risks,â she told French radio. âBut I didnât think that he could die for his ideas.â</p>
<p>In 2005, Mr. Wolinski was awarded the Legion of Honor, one of Franceâs highest distinctions.</p>
<p>Better known as Cabu, Jean Cabut, 76, was among Franceâs most prominent cartoonists. His first drawings were published in a small local paper in Eastern France when he was 16.</p>
<p>After fighting in the Algerian war, Mr. Cabut in the 1960s started drawing for LâHebdo Hara-Kiri and throughout his career contributed to almost every French publication.</p>
<p>Mr. Cabut was best known to the French public for two cartoon characters he created: Grand Duduche and Beauf. Grand Duduche is a blond, tall and slim schoolboy with round glasses and sneakers, bearing some resemblance to Cabu, who was often referred to as an âeternal teenager.â</p>
<p>The cartoon series âMon Beaufââbeauf is short for âbeau-frÃ¨re,â which means brother-in-law in Frenchâpoked fun at the stereotypical French person, who complains about everything and is slightly racist, uneducated and unsatisfied with life. âBeaufâ has become a French slang term for precisely that type of person.</p>
<p>Bernard Verlhac, 57, signed his work with the name Tignous. His work appeared in leftist weekly Marianne, as well as Charlie Hebo and Fluide Glacial.</p>
<p>Mr. Verlhac had a particular interest in court cases. In 2008, he chronicled the lawsuit of Corsican separatist Yvan Colonna in his weekly drawings, which were later published as a book.</p>
<p>Tignous was a member of the Association de la presse judiciare (the Association of Law Reporters), which posted the cartoonistâs last drawing on its website. The cartoon, made to resemble a New Yearâs greeting card, poked fun at President FranÃ§ois Hollande for dressing in a furry hat during his recent visit to Kazakhstan. A photo of Mr. Hollande in the traditional garb last month created buzz on social networks.</p>
<p>Philippe HonorÃ©, 73, was lesser known than some of the other Charlie Hebdo cartoonists. He signed his drawings HonorÃ© and was distinguished by his white bear and long white hair.</p>
<p>Mr. HonorÃ© drew the illustration featured on the <a href="">last tweet</a> sent from Charlie Hebdoâs Twitter feed Wednesday right before the shooting.</p>
<p>The drawing shows a cartoon of Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi giving his best wishes for 2015. âBest wishes by the way,â the tweet reads. âAnd health above all,â Mr. al-Baghdadi is portrayed as saying in the cartoon.</p>
<p>Bernard Maris, 68, was a French economist and a member of the French Central Bankâs general council.</p>
<p>Mr. Maris was a regular contributor to Charlie Hebdo. He was known for a weekly column, written under the pen name Oncle Bernard (Uncle Bernard), in which he explained economics with simple words.</p>
<p>A fierce Keynesian, he joined the Bank of France general council in 2011. He also wrote academic papers and provided economics commentary on French radio.</p>
<p>âBernard Maris was a man of heart, of culture and of tolerance,â Bank of France Governor Christian Noyer said. âWe will miss him.â</p>
<p>Elsa Cayat was the only woman killed in the shooting.</p>
<p>A practicing psychiatrist and psychoanalyst, she contributed to Charlie Hebdo a column called âCharlie Divan,â which dealt with a wide range of issues, from parental authority to sexuality.</p>
<p>Ahmed Merabet, 40, was a Paris-based police officer of French North African descent. He was one of three policemen who <a href="">drove toward the attack scene</a> in an attempt to block the gunmen who were fleeing. Mr. Merabet got out of the car and approached the suspects. He drew his gun and shot at the gunmen but was injured in the lower abdomen in the ensuing firefight.</p>
<p>Mr. Merabetâs death is documented in a video taken by an observer from a nearby rooftop that was broadcast widely on news outlets Wednesday. In the video, one of the gunmen walked toward the injured Mr. Merabet, who was reeling on the ground. âYou wanted to kill us,â said the masked gunman.</p>
<p>âNo, weâre good, boss,â replied Mr. Merabet, raising his hands to show he was unarmed. The gunman then shot Mr. Merabet at close range before fleeing with his accomplice in a car.</p>
<p>FrÃ©dÃ©ric Boisseau, 42, was a maintenance worker with French food services and facilities management company Sodexo, working at the building where Charlie Hebdo had its offices.</p>
<p>Sodexo employees around the world on Thursday afternoon gathered to mourn the death of the father of two.</p>
<p>âWe all share the conviction that such a terrible loss of life is unconscionable,â Sodexo Chief Executive Michel Landel said in a statement. âThe tragic and unjust circumstances are reinforced by its cause, which runs so utterly contrary to our values.â</p>
<p>Franck Brinsolaro was in charge of protecting Mr. Charbonnier, who had received a death threat in 2012.</p>
<p>According to French media, Mr. Renaud was visiting Charlie Hebdo to meet Cabu.</p>
<p>Mustapha Ourrad was an Algerian-born proofreader at Charlie Hebdo, according to French media reports.</p>

          <p>WASHINGTONâU.S. and French intelligence believe that one of the two gunmen in the Paris attack Wednesday received weapons training in Yemen, U.S. officials said</p>
<p>U.S. officials said they believe Said Kouachi trained in Yemen in 2011. French intelligence also has made a similar assessment and has shared it with American officials, according to a U.S. official.</p>
<p>The training was believed to be under the auspices of Yemen-based al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, an al Qaeda offshoot known as AQAP, officials said</p>
<p>U.S. officials said they were looking into any possible continuing ties between the attackers and AQAP. Officials said they have not yet found any intelligence that AQAP directed, ordered or monitored the attack.</p>
<p>âWe know they were inspired, but we do not know the extent they were associated with al Qaeda,â said another U.S. official.</p>

          <p>PARISâTens of thousands of soldiers and police mobilized across France on Thursday amid a manhunt for two brothers who allegedly killed 12 people in a gruesome attack on Charlie Hebdo magazine, as anxious Parisians stopped for a moment of silence to honor the dead.</p>
<p>President FranÃ§ois Hollande raised the terror alert in an area north of Paris where the search was concentrated, after two men matching the description of the suspects were spotted at a gas station. But the twoâboth of whom have been on watch lists of possible terrorists for yearsâremained at large.</p>
<p>French Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve<br />
                <a href="">invited top U.S. and European law-enforcement</a> and counterterrorism officials to Paris this weekend to discuss terror threats, amid concerns that the gunmen appeared to <a href="">have some military acumen</a>.</p>
<p>Nine people, including relatives of the two suspects, were detained for questioning by police in relation to the investigation, Mr. Cazeneuve told a news conference in Paris, without elaborating.</p>
<p>The two suspects in Wednesdayâs spree of violence were identified as 34-year-old Said Kouachi and his brother, ChÃ©rif Kouachi, 32, both French citizens. Mr. Cazeneuve said both were known to French security and were under surveillance, but no incriminating evidence had been gathered on them.</p>
<p>The minister said the elder brother had been formally identified from a photograph as one of the attackers. His national identity card was found in an abandoned CitroÃ«n that had been used as a getaway car.</p>
<p>While Said Kouachi had no police record, his brother had been sentenced to 18 months in prison in 2008 for being part of a terror group, prosecutors said.</p>
<p>Both have been in a U.S. database of suspected terroristsâand on the U.S. no-fly listâfor years as well. For the younger brother, that was due to his conviction in France, while the otherâs name had surfaced in other terrorism-related probes, according to U.S. officials.</p>
<p>A third suspect identified by police turned himself in late Wednesday. His relationship to the others was unclear.</p>
<p>Helicopters buzzed across the region north of Paris early Thursday after two men resembling the Kouachi brothers were spotted near the town of Villers-CotterÃªts, about 50 miles from the capital. But by midafternoon French television showed most of the police had left.</p>
<p>The suspects acted with a mix of militarylike professionalism and surprising clumsiness in Wednesdayâs attack, police officials said.</p>
<p>When arriving in the street of the Charlie Hebdo offices, the alleged gunmen first stepped into the wrong building. But they later displayed a high level of training, wielding their AK-47 rifles with ease, and acting with extreme determination, suggesting the action had been prepared in advance.</p>
<p>The masked gunmenâs attack decimated Charlie Hebdoâs newsroom, which has for years stirred outrageâand death threatsâwith its caricatures lampooning Islam, just one of its many targets of satire.</p>
<p>On Thursday, one of the weeklyâs columnists vowed it would continued publishing, and its website displayed the defiant words, âJe Suis Charlie,â or âI am Charlie,â <a href="">a rallying call for freedom of expression</a> that has spread around the world since the attacks.</p>
<p>At noon on Thursday, many places in Paris fell quiet for a moment of silence.</p>
<p>A crowd held hands to form a circle at the Place de la RÃ©publique, one of the cityâs major squares, and people left pens to symbolize solidarity with the weeklyâs staff.</p>
<p>Parisians gathered in the rain by the Notre Dame cathedral to mourn, and the French flag flew at half-staff over the Grand Palais exhibition hall.</p>
<p><a href=""></a>Adding to the tension, two people, including one police officer, were shot by a lone gunman in the south of Paris early Thursday, Mr. Cazeneuve said, although it wasnât immediately clear if the incident was related to Wednesdayâs attack. The police officer was killed.</p>
<p>After stalking the offices of the satirical magazine with AK-47s, methodically shooting their targets, the suspects fled by car. They clashed with several police patrols, killing one police officer. After crashing their first car, they carjacked a Renault Clio and managed to evade pursuing police to leave the city, Mr. Cazeneuve said.</p>
<p>Police and special forces searched an apartment Wednesday night in the northeastern city of Reims where Said Kouachi had been living, and detained several relatives. On Thursday, the focus had shifted to the nearby Aisne region, specifically Villers-CotterÃªts and the even smaller town of CrÃ©py-en-Valois, where police think the two men could be hiding, according to a police officer.</p>
<p>Residents said dozens of gun-toting special forces searched the town and surrounding hamlets all afternoon while three helicopters flew overhead.</p>
<p>âThe schools were closed,â said Lina Shu, whose family runs Le Roi des Gourmands, a restaurant in town. âThough the police didnât tell us anything about why they were here, some people in the village said it was related to the Charlie Hebdo killing.â</p>
<p>Officials said they were puzzled as to whether the ID card of the elder Mr. Kouachi had been dropped by accident in the getaway car or left voluntarily, in a move to claim responsibility for the attack.</p>
<p>âYou cannot rule out the possibility they left the ID intentionally,â said Emmanuel Quemener, a police officer affiliated with the Alliance union.</p>
<p>The third suspect, Hamid Mourad, 18, turned himself in overnight in the eastern town of Charleville-MÃ©ziÃ¨res, prosecutors said.</p>
<p>The interior minister said some 88,000 army troops and police officers had been mobilized in the search, including nearly 10,000 in Paris alone.</p>
<p>âThe investigation risks being long,â Pierre-Henry Brandet, a ministry spokesman, said on French television iTele. âWe must prepare ourselves for a hunt that could take several days.â</p>
<p>It remained unclear whether the gunmen acted alone or were part of a broader organization. But they appeared to have been motivated by radical Islamist beliefs.</p>
<p>French television showed footage of them leaving Charlie Hebdoâs offices shouting: âWe have avenged Prophet Muhammad. We have killed Charlie Hebdo.â The gunmen also shouted âAllahu akbar,â or âGod is great,â according to a witness cited by Paris prosecutor FranÃ§ois Molins.</p>
<p>The brothers were on the U.S. governmentâs no-fly list and on another watch list known as TIDE for several years, a senior U.S. intelligence official said.</p>
<p>U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder and U.S. Secretary of Homeland Security Jeh Johnson were among those invited to a meeting in Paris on Sunday, along with European Commissioner Dimitris Avramopoulos and the European Unionâs counterterrorism coordinator Gilles de Kerchove.</p>
<p>Aides to Mr. Holder said the talks would center on terror threats, the security risks of people returning from foreign battlefields and countering homegrown violent extremism.</p>
<p>News reports have pointed to possible ties between the Paris gunmen and extremist organizations, but no direct relationship between such organizations and the attackers have been established by authorities, Pentagon officials said.</p>
<p>âIâve seen nothing to suggest this was anything other than individually inspired, and not an organizationally sanctioned event,â said one senior defense official.</p>
<p>Based on the information so far, the Pentagon has taken no steps to boost security either in the U.S. or at its overseas bases.</p>

<p>WASHINGTONâU.S. and French intelligence believe that one of the two gunmen in the Paris attack Wednesday received weapons training in Yemen, U.S. officials said.</p>
<p>Officials said they believe Said Kouachi trained in Yemen in 2011. French intelligence also has made a similar assessment and shared it with American officials, according to a U.S. official.</p>
<p>The training was believed to be under the auspices of Yemen-based al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, an al Qaeda offshoot known as AQAP, officials said.</p>

          <p>WASHINGTONâU.S. military officials Thursday downplayed any indications that the three suspects in the Charlie Hebdo attack were trained or financed by Islamist forces in the Middle East or North Africa.</p>
<p>Although the gunmen involved in the shooting at the French magazine Charlie Hebdo appeared to have some military acumen, Pentagon officials said there were no indications so far to suggest they were trained or financed by extremist groups like Islamic State or al Qaeda.</p>

      </div>
      
      
        <p class="stri-byline">By Paul Vieira</p>
      

      

      
        <div class="stri-full">
          <p>Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper said Thursday the terrorist attack in Paris is evidence the global jihadist movement has &#8220;declared war&#8221; on the west, and that western allies must do whatever is necessary to counter the threat.</p>
<p>&#8220;They have declared war on any country, like ourselves, that values freedom, openness and tolerance,&#8221; Mr. Harper said at a public event in suburban Vancouver. &#8220;We might not like this and wish it would go away, but it is not going to go away. And the reality is we are going to have to confront it.&#8221;</p>
<p>His remarks expanded on his initial reaction to the attack at French satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo, in which 12 people were killed, including several cartoonists. On Wednesday, Mr. Harper described the killings as &#8220;barbaric.&#8221;</p>
<p>French police are searching for two suspects, and French President Francois Hollande met with top ministers Thursday to discuss the crisis. Parisians stopped for a moment of silence to remember those killed in one of the deadliest attacks in the city in decades.</p>
<p>In October, Canada sustained its own terror-inspired attacks, as two Canadian soldiers were killed in separate incidents, including a shooting in Ottawa in which the gunman later stormed Canada&#8217;s parliament buildings before he was fatally shot. Canadian police say they found no links connecting those attacks.</p>
<p>Canadian law-enforcement officials had warned the country was susceptible to terrorist attacks after the government&#8217;s decision to send jet fighters to Iraq to assist the U.S. and allies in a mission against Islamic State militants.</p>
<p>Mr. Harper said Thursday that his government intends to introduce further security measures, aimed at combating and identifying terror threats, when the national legislature returns to work in late January.</p>
