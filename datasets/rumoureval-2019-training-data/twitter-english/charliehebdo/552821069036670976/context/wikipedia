==Background==
{{main|Charlie Hebdo}}
''Charlie Hebdo'' ({{IPA-fr|ʃaʁli ɛbdo}}; [[French language|French]] for ''Charlie Weekly'') is a French [[satirical]] weekly newspaper, featuring cartoons, reports, polemics and jokes. Irreverent and stridently non-conformist in tone, the publication is strongly [[antireligious]]<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.lemonde.fr/idees/article/2013/11/20/non-charlie-hebdo-n-est-pas-raciste_3516646_3232.html | title=Non, "Charlie Hebdo" n’est pas raciste ! | publisher=[[Le Monde]] | accessdate=4 March 2014 | author=Charb}}</ref> and [[Left-wing politics|left-wing]], publishing articles on the extreme right, Catholicism, Islam, Judaism, politics, culture, etc. According to its late editor, [[Charb|Stephane Charbonnier]] (Charb), the magazine's editorial viewpoint reflects "all components of left wing pluralism, and even abstainers".<ref>«Charlie Hebdo, c'est la gauche plurielle» [archive] sur lecourrier.ch du 9 avril 2010</ref>

It first appeared from 1969 to 1981; it folded, but was resurrected in 1992. Stephane Charbonnier (Charb) had been the editor since 2012 until his death in this shooting.
