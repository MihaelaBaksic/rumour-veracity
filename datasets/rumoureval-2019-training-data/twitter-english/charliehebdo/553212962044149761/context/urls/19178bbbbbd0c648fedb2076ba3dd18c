It is generally characterised by extreme violence, social disruption and economic destruction. War should be understood as an actual, intentional and widespread armed conflict between political communities, and therefore is defined as a form of (collective) political violence or intervention. The set of techniques used by a group to carry out war is known as <b>warfare<\/b>. An absence of war is usually called peace.<\/p>\n<p>While some scholars see warfare as an inescapable and integral aspect of human nature, others argue that it is only inevitable under certain socio-cultural or ecological circumstances. For some the practice of war is not linked to any single type of political organization or society. Rather, as discussed by John Keegan in his <i>A History of Warfare<\/i>, war is a universal phenomenon whose form and scope is defined by the society that wages it. Another argument suggests that since there are human societies in which warfare does not exist, humans may not be naturally disposed for warfare, which emerges under particular circumstances.<\/p>\n<p>The deadliest war in history, in terms of the cumulative number of deaths since its start, is the Second World War, with 60–85 million deaths, followed by the Mongol conquests. Proportionally speaking, the most destructive war in modern history is the War of the Triple Alliance, which took the lives of over 60% of Paraguay's population, according to Steven Pinker. In 2003, Richard Smalley identified war as the sixth (of ten) biggest problems facing humanity for the next fifty years.<\/p>\n<p><\/p>","created_on":"2012-11-28T17:18:48","latitude":null,"geohash":"","short_permalink":"/web/20150108141741/http://www.breakingnews.com\/t\/P","image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"/web/20150108141741/http://en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/War\">Wikipedia<\/a>","item_count":27735,"category":"Topic","local_url":"\/topic\/war-conflict\/","kind":"vertical","muted_by_default":false,"links":"","daily_count":60,"livevideo":"","items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=15","moderation_status":"approved","twitter_username":null,"slug":"war-conflict","related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=15","facebookchat":"","recent_count":12,"latest_item_date":"2015-01-08T14:11:42.155484","wikipedia_url":"/web/20150108141741/http://en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/War","name":"war & conflict","permalink":"/web/20150108141741/http://www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/war-conflict\/","image_url":"/web/20150108141741/http://upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/a\/a7\/Cyprian_War.jpg","placetype":"","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/15\/","active":true,"woeid":null}],"content":"Photo: Police presence in the French countryside near Longpont, Picardy, near Paris - @Glecardonnel","url":"/web/20150108141741/https://twitter.com\/Glecardonnel\/status\/553187208661053440\/photo\/1","type":"text","slug":"photo-police-presence-in-the-french-countryside-n","url_domain":"twitter.com","status":"published","pushed":false,"push_content":"Photo: Police presence in the French countryside near Longpont, Picardy, near Paris - @Glecardonnel","id":494433,"permalink":"/web/20150108141741/http://www.breakingnews.com\/item\/2015\/01\/08\/photo-police-presence-in-the-french-countryside-n","data_type":null,"media":{"author_name":"Gautier Lecardonnel","height":720,"html":"","url":"/web/20150108141741/http://pbs.twimg.com\/media\/B61Q1dLIMAEufoE.jpg","thumbnail_width":150,"type":"photo","id":60336,"original_url":"/web/20150108141741/http://twitter.com\/Glecardonnel\/status\/553187208661053440\/photo\/1","thumbnail_height":150,"thumbnail_url":"/web/20150108141741/http://pbs.twimg.com\/media\/B61Q1dLIMAEufoE.jpg:thumb","provider_url":"/web/20150108141741/https://twitter.com","title":"La D17 direction Longpont coupée par les gendarmes.

Common definitions of terrorism refer only to those violent acts that are intended to create fear (terror); are perpetrated for a religious, political, or ideological goal; and deliberately target or disregard the safety of non-combatants (e.g., neutral military personnel or civilians). Some definitions now include acts of unlawful violence and war. The use of similar tactics by criminal organizations for protection rackets or to enforce a code of silence is usually not labeled terrorism, though these same actions may be labeled terrorism when done by a politically motivated group. Usage of the term has also been criticized for its frequent undue equating with <i>Islamism<\/i> or <i>jihadism<\/i>, while ignoring non-Islamic organizations or individuals.<\/p>\r\n<p>The word \"terrorism\" is politically loaded and emotionally charged, and this greatly compounds the difficulty of providing a precise definition. Studies have found over 100 definitions of \"terrorism\". In some cases, the same group may be described as \"freedom fighters\" by its supporters and considered to be terrorists by its opponents. The concept of terrorism may be controversial as it is often used by state authorities (and individuals with access to state support) to delegitimize political or other opponents, and potentially legitimize the state's own use of armed force against opponents (such use of force may be described as \"terror\" by opponents of the state). At the same time, the reverse may also take place when states perpetrate or are accused of perpetrating state terrorism. The usage of the term has a controversial history, with individuals such as ANC leader Nelson Mandela at one point also branded a terrorist.<\/p>\r\n<p>Terrorism has been practiced by a broad array of political organizations to further their objectives. It has been practiced by both right-wing and left-wing political parties, nationalistic groups, religious groups, revolutionaries, and ruling governments. An abiding characteristic is the indiscriminate use of violence against non-combatants for the purpose of gaining publicity for a group, cause, or individual. The symbolism of terrorism can exploit human fear to help achieve these goals.<\/p>\r\n<p><\/p>","created_on":"2011-05-16T17:28:30","latitude":null,"geohash":"","short_permalink":"/web/20150108141741/http://www.breakingnews.com\/t\/Lc","image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"/web/20150108141741/http://en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Terrorism\">Wikipedia<\/a>","item_count":2031,"category":"Subvertical","local_url":"\/topic\/terrorism\/","kind":"tag","muted_by_default":false,"links":"","daily_count":65,"livevideo":"","items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=710","moderation_status":"approved","twitter_username":null,"slug":"terrorism","related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=710","facebookchat":"","recent_count":10,"latest_item_date":"2015-01-08T14:11:42.155484","wikipedia_url":"/web/20150108141741/http://en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Terrorism","name":"terrorism","permalink":"/web/20150108141741/http://www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/terrorism\/","image_url":"/web/20150108141741/http://upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/8\/8a\/UA_Flight_175_hits_WTC_south_tower_9-11_edit.jpeg","placetype":"","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/710\/","active":true,"woeid":null},{"id":1,"longitude":null,"description":"<p>In ordinary language, the term <b>crime<\/b> denotes an unlawful act punishable by a state.

One proposed definition is that a <b>crime<\/b>, also called an <b>offence<\/b> or a <b>criminal offence<\/b>, is an act harmful not only to some individual, but also to the community or the state (a public wrong).

His predecessors are François Cavanna (1969–1981) and Philippe Val (1992–2009).<\/p>\n<p>The magazine is published every Wednesday, with special editions issued on an unscheduled basis.<\/p>\n<p><\/p>","created_on":"2012-09-19T08:00:56","latitude":null,"geohash":"","short_permalink":"/web/20150108141741/http://www.breakingnews.com\/t\/EbX","image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"/web/20150108141741/http://en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Charlie_Hebdo\">Wikipedia<\/a>","item_count":77,"category":"PublishedMedium","local_url":"\/topic\/charlie-hebdo\/","kind":"tag","muted_by_default":false,"links":"","daily_count":45,"livevideo":"","items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=17073","moderation_status":"approved","twitter_username":null,"slug":"charlie-hebdo","related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=17073","facebookchat":"","recent_count":1,"latest_item_date":"2015-01-08T13:45:54.891329","wikipedia_url":"/web/20150108141741/http://en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Charlie_Hebdo","name":"Charlie Hebdo","permalink":"/web/20150108141741/http://www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/charlie-hebdo\/","image_url":"/web/20150108141741/http://upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/b\/b0\/Fran%C3%A7ois_Cavanna.jpg","placetype":"","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/17073\/","active":true,"woeid":null},{"id":103055,"longitude":null,"description":"","created_on":"2015-01-08T08:36:39.066861","latitude":null,"geohash":"","short_permalink":"/web/20150108141741/http://www.breakingnews.com\/t\/ayL","image_credit":"","item_count":1,"category":"Person","local_url":"\/topic\/franck-brinsolaro\/","kind":"tag","muted_by_default":false,"links":"","daily_count":1,"livevideo":"","items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=103055","moderation_status":"needs_review","twitter_username":null,"slug":"franck-brinsolaro","related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=103055","facebookchat":"","recent_count":1,"latest_item_date":"2015-01-08T13:45:54.891329","wikipedia_url":"","name":"Franck Brinsolaro","permalink":"/web/20150108141741/http://www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/franck-brinsolaro\/","image_url":"","placetype":"","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/103055\/","active":true,"woeid":null},{"id":710,"longitude":null,"description":"<p>In the international community, <b>terrorism<\/b> has no legally binding, criminal law definition.

Common definitions of terrorism refer only to those violent acts that are intended to create fear (terror); are perpetrated for a religious, political, or ideological goal; and deliberately target or disregard the safety of non-combatants (e.g., neutral military personnel or civilians). Some definitions now include acts of unlawful violence and war. The use of similar tactics by criminal organizations for protection rackets or to enforce a code of silence is usually not labeled terrorism, though these same actions may be labeled terrorism when done by a politically motivated group. Usage of the term has also been criticized for its frequent undue equating with <i>Islamism<\/i> or <i>jihadism<\/i>, while ignoring non-Islamic organizations or individuals.<\/p>\r\n<p>The word \"terrorism\" is politically loaded and emotionally charged, and this greatly compounds the difficulty of providing a precise definition. Studies have found over 100 definitions of \"terrorism\". In some cases, the same group may be described as \"freedom fighters\" by its supporters and considered to be terrorists by its opponents. The concept of terrorism may be controversial as it is often used by state authorities (and individuals with access to state support) to delegitimize political or other opponents, and potentially legitimize the state's own use of armed force against opponents (such use of force may be described as \"terror\" by opponents of the state). At the same time, the reverse may also take place when states perpetrate or are accused of perpetrating state terrorism. The usage of the term has a controversial history, with individuals such as ANC leader Nelson Mandela at one point also branded a terrorist.<\/p>\r\n<p>Terrorism has been practiced by a broad array of political organizations to further their objectives. It has been practiced by both right-wing and left-wing political parties, nationalistic groups, religious groups, revolutionaries, and ruling governments. An abiding characteristic is the indiscriminate use of violence against non-combatants for the purpose of gaining publicity for a group, cause, or individual. The symbolism of terrorism can exploit human fear to help achieve these goals.<\/p>\r\n<p><\/p>","created_on":"2011-05-16T17:28:30","latitude":null,"geohash":"","short_permalink":"/web/20150108141741/http://www.breakingnews.com\/t\/Lc","image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"/web/20150108141741/http://en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Terrorism\">Wikipedia<\/a>","item_count":2031,"category":"Subvertical","local_url":"\/topic\/terrorism\/","kind":"tag","muted_by_default":false,"links":"","daily_count":65,"livevideo":"","items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=710","moderation_status":"approved","twitter_username":null,"slug":"terrorism","related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=710","facebookchat":"","recent_count":10,"latest_item_date":"2015-01-08T14:11:42.155484","wikipedia_url":"/web/20150108141741/http://en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Terrorism","name":"terrorism","permalink":"/web/20150108141741/http://www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/terrorism\/","image_url":"/web/20150108141741/http://upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/8\/8a\/UA_Flight_175_hits_WTC_south_tower_9-11_edit.jpeg","placetype":"","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/710\/","active":true,"woeid":null},{"id":1,"longitude":null,"description":"<p>In ordinary language, the term <b>crime<\/b> denotes an unlawful act punishable by a state. The term crime does not, in modern criminal law, have any simple and universally accepted definition, though statutory definitions have been provided for certain purposes. The most popular view is that crime is a category created by law (i.e. something is a crime if applicable law says that it is). One proposed definition is that a <b>crime<\/b>, also called an <b>offence<\/b> or a <b>criminal offence<\/b>, is an act harmful not only to some individual, but also to the community or the state (a public wrong). Such acts are forbidden and punishable by law.<\/p>\r\n<p>The idea that acts like murder, rape and theft are prohibited exists all around the world. What precisely is a criminal offence is defined by criminal law of each country. While many have a catalogue of crimes called the criminal code, in some common law countries no such comprehensive statute exists.<\/p>\r\n<p>The state (government) has the power to severely restrict one's liberty for committing a crime. Therefore, in modern societies, a criminal procedure must be adhered to during the investigation and trial. Only if found guilty, the offender may be sentenced to punishment such as community sentence, imprisonment, life imprisonment or, in some jurisdictions, even death.<\/p>\r\n<p>To be classified as a crime, the act of doing something bad (actus reus) must be usually accompanied by the intention to do something bad (mens rea), with certain exceptions (strict liability).<\/p>\r\n<p>While every crime violates the law, not every violation of the law counts as a crime.

It is generally characterised by extreme violence, social disruption and economic destruction. War should be understood as an actual, intentional and widespread armed conflict between political communities, and therefore is defined as a form of (collective) political violence or intervention. The set of techniques used by a group to carry out war is known as <b>warfare<\/b>. An absence of war is usually called peace.<\/p>\n<p>While some scholars see warfare as an inescapable and integral aspect of human nature, others argue that it is only inevitable under certain socio-cultural or ecological circumstances. For some the practice of war is not linked to any single type of political organization or society. Rather, as discussed by John Keegan in his <i>A History of Warfare<\/i>, war is a universal phenomenon whose form and scope is defined by the society that wages it. Another argument suggests that since there are human societies in which warfare does not exist, humans may not be naturally disposed for warfare, which emerges under particular circumstances.<\/p>\n<p>The deadliest war in history, in terms of the cumulative number of deaths since its start, is the Second World War, with 60–85 million deaths, followed by the Mongol conquests. Proportionally speaking, the most destructive war in modern history is the War of the Triple Alliance, which took the lives of over 60% of Paraguay's population, according to Steven Pinker.

Metropolitan France extends from the Mediterranean Sea to the English Channel and the North Sea, and from the Rhine to the Atlantic Ocean; due to its shape, it is often referred to in French as <i>l’Hexagone<\/i> (\"The Hexagon\"). France is one of only three countries (with Morocco and Spain) to have both Atlantic and Mediterranean coastlines.<\/p>\n<p>By area, France is the 42nd largest country in the world but the largest country in Western Europe and the European Union (EU), and the third-largest in Europe as a whole. With a population approaching 67 million, it is the 20th most populated country and the second-most populated country in the EU. France is a semi-presidential republic with its capital in Paris, the nation's largest city and the main cultural and commercial center. The current Constitution of France, adopted by referendum on 4 October 1958, establishes the country as secular and democratic, with its sovereignty derived from the people. The nation's ideals are expressed in the <i>Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen<\/i>, one of the world's earliest documents on human rights, which was formulated during the seminal French Revolution of the late 18th century.<\/p>\n<p>France has been a major power in Europe since the Late Middle Ages, reaching the height of global prominence during the 19th and early 20th centuries, when it possessed the second-largest colonial empire in the world. Throughout its long history, France has produced many influential artists, thinkers, and scientists, and remains a prominent global center of culture. It hosts the world's fourth-largest number of cultural UNESCO World Heritage Sites and receives around 83 million foreign tourists annually – the most of any country in the world.<\/p>\n<p>France remains a great power with significant cultural, economic, military, and political influence in Europe and around the world. It has the world's fifth-largest military budget, third-largest stockpile of nuclear weapons, and second-largest diplomatic corps. Due to its overseas regions and territories throughout the world, France has the second-largest exclusive economic zone in the world. France is a developed country and has the world's fifth-largest economy by nominal GDP and seventh-largest by purchasing power parity. In terms of total household wealth, France is the wealthiest nation in Europe and fourth in the world.<\/p>\n<p>French citizens enjoy a high standard of living, and the country performs well in international rankings of education, health care, life expectancy, civil liberties, and human development.

Metropolitan France extends from the Mediterranean Sea to the English Channel and the North Sea, and from the Rhine to the Atlantic Ocean; due to its shape, it is often referred to in French as <i>l’Hexagone<\/i> (\"The Hexagon\"). France is one of only three countries (with Morocco and Spain) to have both Atlantic and Mediterranean coastlines.<\/p>\n<p>By area, France is the 42nd largest country in the world but the largest country in Western Europe and the European Union (EU), and the third-largest in Europe as a whole. With a population approaching 67 million, it is the 20th most populated country and the second-most populated country in the EU. France is a semi-presidential republic with its capital in Paris, the nation's largest city and the main cultural and commercial center. The current Constitution of France, adopted by referendum on 4 October 1958, establishes the country as secular and democratic, with its sovereignty derived from the people. The nation's ideals are expressed in the <i>Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen<\/i>, one of the world's earliest documents on human rights, which was formulated during the seminal French Revolution of the late 18th century.<\/p>\n<p>France has been a major power in Europe since the Late Middle Ages, reaching the height of global prominence during the 19th and early 20th centuries, when it possessed the second-largest colonial empire in the world. Throughout its long history, France has produced many influential artists, thinkers, and scientists, and remains a prominent global center of culture. It hosts the world's fourth-largest number of cultural UNESCO World Heritage Sites and receives around 83 million foreign tourists annually – the most of any country in the world.<\/p>\n<p>France remains a great power with significant cultural, economic, military, and political influence in Europe and around the world. It has the world's fifth-largest military budget, third-largest stockpile of nuclear weapons, and second-largest diplomatic corps. Due to its overseas regions and territories throughout the world, France has the second-largest exclusive economic zone in the world. France is a developed country and has the world's fifth-largest economy by nominal GDP and seventh-largest by purchasing power parity. In terms of total household wealth, France is the wealthiest nation in Europe and fourth in the world.<\/p>\n<p>French citizens enjoy a high standard of living, and the country performs well in international rankings of education, health care, life expectancy, civil liberties, and human development. France is a founding member of the United Nations, where it serves as one of the five permanent members of the UN Security Council. It is a member of numerous international institutions, including the Group of 7, North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), the World Trade Organization (WTO), and La Francophonie. France is a founding and leading member state of the EU.<\/p>\n<p><\/p>\n","created_on":"2011-05-16T22:37:58","latitude":46.7107,"geohash":"u031xp7js9x6","short_permalink":"/web/20150108141741/http://www.breakingnews.com\/t\/D6","image_credit":"<a href=\"/web/20150108141741/http://en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/France\">Wikipedia<\/a>","item_count":2634,"category":"Country","local_url":"\/topic\/france\/","kind":"location","muted_by_default":false,"links":"","daily_count":43,"livevideo":"","items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=244","moderation_status":"approved","twitter_username":null,"slug":"france","related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=244","facebookchat":"","recent_count":2,"latest_item_date":"2015-01-08T12:28:40.359567","wikipedia_url":"/web/20150108141741/http://en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/France","name":"France","permalink":"/web/20150108141741/http://www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/france\/","image_url":"/web/20150108141741/http://upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/en\/c\/c3\/Flag_of_France.svg","placetype":"Country","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/244\/","active":true,"woeid":23424819},{"id":515,"longitude":2.3412,"description":"","created_on":"2011-04-22T01:31:35","latitude":48.8569,"geohash":"u09tvq0u44k8","short_permalink":"/web/20150108141741/http://www.breakingnews.com\/t\/IT","image_credit":"","item_count":541,"category":"Town","local_url":"\/topic\/paris-ile-de-france-fr\/","kind":"location","muted_by_default":false,"links":"","daily_count":89,"livevideo":"","items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=515","moderation_status":"approved","twitter_username":null,"slug":"paris-ile-de-france-fr","related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=515","facebookchat":"","recent_count":13,"latest_item_date":"2015-01-08T14:11:42.155484","wikipedia_url":"","name":"Paris, Ile-de-France, FR","permalink":"/web/20150108141741/http://www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/paris-ile-de-france-fr\/","image_url":"","placetype":"Town","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/515\/","active":true,"woeid":615702},{"id":1,"longitude":null,"description":"<p>In ordinary language, the term <b>crime<\/b> denotes an unlawful act punishable by a state.

It is the most populous city in the United Kingdom with a metropolitan area of over 13 million inhabitants. Standing on the River Thames, London has been a major settlement for two millennia, its history going back to its founding by the Romans, who named it <i>Londinium<\/i>. London's ancient core, the City of London, largely retains its 1.12-square-mile (2.9 km<sup>2<\/sup>) mediaeval boundaries and in 2011 had a resident population of 7,375, making it the smallest city in England. Since at least the 19th century, the term <i>London<\/i> has also referred to the metropolis developed around this core. The bulk of this conurbation forms the Greater London administrative area (coterminous with the London region), governed by the Mayor of London and the London Assembly.<\/p>\n<p>London is a leading global city, with strengths in the arts, commerce, education, entertainment, fashion, finance, healthcare, media, professional services, research and development, tourism and transport all contributing to its prominence. It is one of the world's leading financial centres and has the fifth-or sixth-largest metropolitan area GDP in the world depending on measurement. London is a world cultural capital. It is the world's most-visited city as measured by international arrivals and has the world's largest city airport system measured by passenger traffic. London's 43 universities form the largest concentration of higher education in Europe. In 2012, London became the first city to host the modern Summer Olympic Games three times.<\/p>\n<p>London has a diverse range of peoples and cultures, and more than 300 languages are spoken within Greater London. The region had an official population of 8,416,535 in 2013, making it the most populous municipality in the European Union, and accounting for 12.5% of the UK population. London's urban area is the second-largest in the EU with a population of 9,787,426 according to the 2011 census. London's metropolitan area is the largest in the EU with a total population of 13,614,409, while the Greater London Authority puts the population of London metropolitan region at 21 million. London was the world's most populous city from around 1831 to 1925.<\/p>\n<p>London contains four World Heritage Sites: the Tower of London; Kew Gardens; the site comprising the Palace of Westminster, Westminster Abbey, and St Margaret's Church; and the historic settlement of Greenwich (in which the Royal Observatory, Greenwich marks the Prime Meridian, 0° longitude, and GMT). Other famous landmarks include Buckingham Palace, the London Eye, Piccadilly Circus, St Paul's Cathedral, Tower Bridge, Trafalgar Square, and The Shard. London is home to numerous museums, galleries, libraries, sporting events and other cultural institutions, including the British Museum, National Gallery, Tate Modern, British Library and 40 West End theatres. The London Underground is the oldest underground railway network in the world.<\/p>","created_on":"2012-11-28T19:13:37","latitude":51.5077,"geohash":"gcpvj07mvqjx","short_permalink":"/web/20150108141741/http://www.breakingnews.com\/t\/Cp","image_credit":"<a href=\"/web/20150108141741/http://en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/London\">Wikipedia<\/a>","item_count":2996,"category":"Town","local_url":"\/topic\/london-england-gb\/","kind":"location","muted_by_default":false,"links":"","daily_count":2,"livevideo":"","items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=165","moderation_status":"approved","twitter_username":null,"slug":"london-england-gb","related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=165","facebookchat":"","recent_count":1,"latest_item_date":"2015-01-08T12:10:08.408151","wikipedia_url":"/web/20150108141741/http://en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/London","name":"London, England, GB","permalink":"/web/20150108141741/http://www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/london-england-gb\/","image_url":"/web/20150108141741/http://upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/2\/29\/London-boroughs.svg","placetype":"Town","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/165\/","active":true,"woeid":44418},{"id":515,"longitude":2.3412,"description":"","created_on":"2011-04-22T01:31:35","latitude":48.8569,"geohash":"u09tvq0u44k8","short_permalink":"/web/20150108141741/http://www.breakingnews.com\/t\/IT","image_credit":"","item_count":541,"category":"Town","local_url":"\/topic\/paris-ile-de-france-fr\/","kind":"location","muted_by_default":false,"links":"","daily_count":89,"livevideo":"","items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=515","moderation_status":"approved","twitter_username":null,"slug":"paris-ile-de-france-fr","related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=515","facebookchat":"","recent_count":13,"latest_item_date":"2015-01-08T14:11:42.155484","wikipedia_url":"","name":"Paris, Ile-de-France, FR","permalink":"/web/20150108141741/http://www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/paris-ile-de-france-fr\/","image_url":"","placetype":"Town","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/515\/","active":true,"woeid":615702},{"id":30,"longitude":-2.23001,"description":"<p>The <b>United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland<\/b>, commonly known as the <b>United Kingdom<\/b> (<b>UK<\/b>) or <b>Britain<\/b> \/ˈbrɪ.tən\/, is a sovereign state located off the northwestern coast of continental Europe. The country includes the island of Great Britain (a term sometimes also loosely applied to the whole state), the northeastern part of the island of Ireland, and many smaller islands. Northern Ireland is the only part of the UK that shares a land border with another state: the Republic of Ireland. Apart from this land border, the UK is surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean, with the North Sea in the east and the English Channel in the south; the Irish Sea separates Great Britain from Ireland. The UK has an area of 243,610 square kilometres (94,060 sq mi), making it the 78th largest sovereign state in the world and the 11th largest in Europe.<\/p>\n<p>The United Kingdom is the 22nd most populous country, with an estimated 64.1 million inhabitants. It is a constitutional monarchy and has a parliamentary system of governance. Its capital city is London, an important global city and financial centre with the second-largest urban area in the European Union. The current British monarch—since 6 February 1952—is Queen Elizabeth II. The UK consists of four countries: England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. The latter three have devolved administrations, each with varying powers, based in their capitals, Edinburgh, Cardiff and Belfast, respectively. Guernsey, Jersey and the Isle of Man are not part of the United Kingdom, being Crown dependencies with the British Government responsible for defence and international representation. The United Kingdom has fourteen Overseas Territories, including the disputed Falkland Islands and Gibraltar.<\/p>\n<p>The relationships among the countries of the United Kingdom have changed over time. The Principality of Wales was incorporated into the Kingdom of England in 1536. In 1707, the kingdoms of Scotland and England were united to form the Kingdom of Great Britain, which in 1801, united with the Kingdom of Ireland to form the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland. In 1922, five-sixths of Ireland seceded from the UK, leaving the present formulation of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. British Overseas Territories, formerly colonies, are the remnants of the British Empire which, at its height in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, encompassed almost a quarter of the world's land mass and was the largest empire in history. British influence can be observed in the language, culture and legal systems of many of its former colonies.<\/p>\n<p>The United Kingdom is a developed country and has the world's sixth-largest economy by nominal GDP and eighth-largest by purchasing power parity. It was the world's first industrialised country and the world's foremost power during the 19th and early 20th centuries. The UK remains a great power with considerable economic, cultural, military, scientific and political influence internationally. It is a recognised nuclear weapons state and its military expenditure ranks from fourth to sixth (depending on the source) in the world. The UK has been a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council since its first session in 1946. It has been a member of the European Union (EU) and its predecessor the European Economic Community (EEC) since 1973; it is also a member of the Commonwealth of Nations, the Council of Europe, the G7, the G8, the G20, NATO, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and the World Trade Organization (WTO).<\/p>\n<p><\/p>","created_on":"2011-05-16T17:43:35","latitude":54.3141,"geohash":"gcwkvr84t404","short_permalink":"/web/20150108141741/http://www.breakingnews.com\/t\/e","image_credit":"<a href=\"/web/20150108141741/http://en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/United_Kingdom\">Wikipedia<\/a>","item_count":7187,"category":"Country","local_url":"\/topic\/united-kingdom\/","kind":"location","muted_by_default":false,"links":"","daily_count":4,"livevideo":"","items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=30","moderation_status":"approved","twitter_username":null,"slug":"united-kingdom","related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=30","facebookchat":"","recent_count":3,"latest_item_date":"2015-01-08T13:32:29.604013","wikipedia_url":"/web/20150108141741/http://en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/United_Kingdom","name":"United Kingdom","permalink":"/web/20150108141741/http://www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/united-kingdom\/","image_url":"/web/20150108141741/http://upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/f\/f7\/Royal_Coat_of_Arms_of_the_United_Kingdom_%28Scotland%29.svg","placetype":"Country","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/30\/","active":true,"woeid":23424975},{"id":710,"longitude":null,"description":"<p>In the international community, <b>terrorism<\/b> has no legally binding, criminal law definition. Common definitions of terrorism refer only to those violent acts that are intended to create fear (terror); are perpetrated for a religious, political, or ideological goal; and deliberately target or disregard the safety of non-combatants (e.g., neutral military personnel or civilians). Some definitions now include acts of unlawful violence and war. The use of similar tactics by criminal organizations for protection rackets or to enforce a code of silence is usually not labeled terrorism, though these same actions may be labeled terrorism when done by a politically motivated group. Usage of the term has also been criticized for its frequent undue equating with <i>Islamism<\/i> or <i>jihadism<\/i>, while ignoring non-Islamic organizations or individuals.<\/p>\r\n<p>The word \"terrorism\" is politically loaded and emotionally charged, and this greatly compounds the difficulty of providing a precise definition. Studies have found over 100 definitions of \"terrorism\". In some cases, the same group may be described as \"freedom fighters\" by its supporters and considered to be terrorists by its opponents. The concept of terrorism may be controversial as it is often used by state authorities (and individuals with access to state support) to delegitimize political or other opponents, and potentially legitimize the state's own use of armed force against opponents (such use of force may be described as \"terror\" by opponents of the state). At the same time, the reverse may also take place when states perpetrate or are accused of perpetrating state terrorism. The usage of the term has a controversial history, with individuals such as ANC leader Nelson Mandela at one point also branded a terrorist.<\/p>\r\n<p>Terrorism has been practiced by a broad array of political organizations to further their objectives. It has been practiced by both right-wing and left-wing political parties, nationalistic groups, religious groups, revolutionaries, and ruling governments. An abiding characteristic is the indiscriminate use of violence against non-combatants for the purpose of gaining publicity for a group, cause, or individual. The symbolism of terrorism can exploit human fear to help achieve these goals.<\/p>\r\n<p><\/p>","created_on":"2011-05-16T17:28:30","latitude":null,"geohash":"","short_permalink":"/web/20150108141741/http://www.breakingnews.com\/t\/Lc","image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"/web/20150108141741/http://en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Terrorism\">Wikipedia<\/a>","item_count":2031,"category":"Subvertical","local_url":"\/topic\/terrorism\/","kind":"tag","muted_by_default":false,"links":"","daily_count":65,"livevideo":"","items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=710","moderation_status":"approved","twitter_username":null,"slug":"terrorism","related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=710","facebookchat":"","recent_count":10,"latest_item_date":"2015-01-08T14:11:42.155484","wikipedia_url":"/web/20150108141741/http://en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Terrorism","name":"terrorism","permalink":"/web/20150108141741/http://www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/terrorism\/","image_url":"/web/20150108141741/http://upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/8\/8a\/UA_Flight_175_hits_WTC_south_tower_9-11_edit.jpeg","placetype":"","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/710\/","active":true,"woeid":null},{"id":1,"longitude":null,"description":"<p>In ordinary language, the term <b>crime<\/b> denotes an unlawful act punishable by a state. The term crime does not, in modern criminal law, have any simple and universally accepted definition, though statutory definitions have been provided for certain purposes. The most popular view is that crime is a category created by law (i.e. something is a crime if applicable law says that it is). One proposed definition is that a <b>crime<\/b>, also called an <b>offence<\/b> or a <b>criminal offence<\/b>, is an act harmful not only to some individual, but also to the community or the state (a public wrong). Such acts are forbidden and punishable by law.<\/p>\r\n<p>The idea that acts like murder, rape and theft are prohibited exists all around the world.

War should be understood as an actual, intentional and widespread armed conflict between political communities, and therefore is defined as a form of (collective) political violence or intervention. The set of techniques used by a group to carry out war is known as <b>warfare<\/b>. An absence of war is usually called peace.<\/p>\n<p>While some scholars see warfare as an inescapable and integral aspect of human nature, others argue that it is only inevitable under certain socio-cultural or ecological circumstances. For some the practice of war is not linked to any single type of political organization or society. Rather, as discussed by John Keegan in his <i>A History of Warfare<\/i>, war is a universal phenomenon whose form and scope is defined by the society that wages it. Another argument suggests that since there are human societies in which warfare does not exist, humans may not be naturally disposed for warfare, which emerges under particular circumstances.<\/p>\n<p>The deadliest war in history, in terms of the cumulative number of deaths since its start, is the Second World War, with 60–85 million deaths, followed by the Mongol conquests.

The term crime does not, in modern criminal law, have any simple and universally accepted definition, though statutory definitions have been provided for certain purposes. The most popular view is that crime is a category created by law (i.e. something is a crime if applicable law says that it is). One proposed definition is that a <b>crime<\/b>, also called an <b>offence<\/b> or a <b>criminal offence<\/b>, is an act harmful not only to some individual, but also to the community or the state (a public wrong). Such acts are forbidden and punishable by law.<\/p>\r\n<p>The idea that acts like murder, rape and theft are prohibited exists all around the world. What precisely is a criminal offence is defined by criminal law of each country. While many have a catalogue of crimes called the criminal code, in some common law countries no such comprehensive statute exists.<\/p>\r\n<p>The state (government) has the power to severely restrict one's liberty for committing a crime. Therefore, in modern societies, a criminal procedure must be adhered to during the investigation and trial. Only if found guilty, the offender may be sentenced to punishment such as community sentence, imprisonment, life imprisonment or, in some jurisdictions, even death.<\/p>\r\n<p>To be classified as a crime, the act of doing something bad (actus reus) must be usually accompanied by the intention to do something bad (mens rea), with certain exceptions (strict liability).<\/p>\r\n<p>While every crime violates the law, not every violation of the law counts as a crime.

the international community, <b>terrorism<\/b> has no legally binding, criminal law definition. Common definitions of terrorism refer only to those violent acts that are intended to create fear (terror); are perpetrated for a religious, political, or ideological goal; and deliberately target or disregard the safety of non-combatants (e.g., neutral military personnel or civilians). Some definitions now include acts of unlawful violence and war. The use of similar tactics by criminal organizations for protection rackets or to enforce a code of silence is usually not labeled terrorism, though these same actions may be labeled terrorism when done by a politically motivated group. Usage of the term has also been criticized for its frequent undue equating with <i>Islamism<\/i> or <i>jihadism<\/i>, while ignoring non-Islamic organizations or individuals.<\/p>\r\n<p>The word \"terrorism\" is politically loaded and emotionally charged, and this greatly compounds the difficulty of providing a precise definition. Studies have found over 100 definitions of \"terrorism\". In some cases, the same group may be described as \"freedom fighters\" by its supporters and considered to be terrorists by its opponents. The concept of terrorism may be controversial as it is often used by state authorities (and individuals with access to state support) to delegitimize political or other opponents, and potentially legitimize the state's own use of armed force against opponents (such use of force may be described as \"terror\" by opponents of the state). At the same time, the reverse may also take place when states perpetrate or are accused of perpetrating state terrorism. The usage of the term has a controversial history, with individuals such as ANC leader Nelson Mandela at one point also branded a terrorist.<\/p>\r\n<p>Terrorism has been practiced by a broad array of political organizations to further their objectives. It has been practiced by both right-wing and left-wing political parties, nationalistic groups, religious groups, revolutionaries, and ruling governments. An abiding characteristic is the indiscriminate use of violence against non-combatants for the purpose of gaining publicity for a group, cause, or individual. The symbolism of terrorism can exploit human fear to help achieve these goals.<\/p>\r\n<p><\/p>","created_on":"2011-05-16T17:28:30","latitude":null,"geohash":"","short_permalink":"/web/20150108141741/http://www.breakingnews.com\/t\/Lc","image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"/web/20150108141741/http://en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Terrorism\">Wikipedia<\/a>","item_count":2031,"category":"Subvertical","local_url":"\/topic\/terrorism\/","kind":"tag","muted_by_default":false,"links":"","daily_count":65,"livevideo":"","items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=710","moderation_status":"approved","twitter_username":null,"slug":"terrorism","related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=710","facebookchat":"","recent_count":10,"latest_item_date":"2015-01-08T14:11:42.155484","wikipedia_url":"/web/20150108141741/http://en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Terrorism","name":"terrorism","permalink":"/web/20150108141741/http://www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/terrorism\/","image_url":"/web/20150108141741/http://upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/8\/8a\/UA_Flight_175_hits_WTC_south_tower_9-11_edit.jpeg","placetype":"","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/710\/","active":true,"woeid":null},{"id":1,"longitude":null,"description":"<p>In ordinary language, the term <b>crime<\/b> denotes an unlawful act punishable by a state.

The term crime does not, in modern criminal law, have any simple and universally accepted definition, though statutory definitions have been provided for certain purposes. The most popular view is that crime is a category created by law (i.e. something is a crime if applicable law says that it is). One proposed definition is that a <b>crime<\/b>, also called an <b>offence<\/b> or a <b>criminal offence<\/b>, is an act harmful not only to some individual, but also to the community or the state (a public wrong). Such acts are forbidden and punishable by law.<\/p>\r\n<p>The idea that acts like murder, rape and theft are prohibited exists all around the world. What precisely is a criminal offence is defined by criminal law of each country. While many have a catalogue of crimes called the criminal code, in some common law countries no such comprehensive statute exists.<\/p>\r\n<p>The state (government) has the power to severely restrict one's liberty for committing a crime. Therefore, in modern societies, a criminal procedure must be adhered to during the investigation and trial. Only if found guilty, the offender may be sentenced to punishment such as community sentence, imprisonment, life imprisonment or, in some jurisdictions, even death.<\/p>\r\n<p>To be classified as a crime, the act of doing something bad (actus reus) must be usually accompanied by the intention to do something bad (mens rea), with certain exceptions (strict liability).<\/p>\r\n<p>While every crime violates the law, not every violation of the law counts as a crime. Breaches of private law (torts and breaches of contract) are not automatically punished by the state, but can be enforced through civil procedure.<\/p>\r\n<p><\/p>","created_on":"2012-11-28T17:18:53","latitude":null,"geohash":"","short_permalink":"/web/20150108141741/http://www.breakingnews.com\/t\/B","image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"/web/20150108141741/http://en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Crime\">Wikipedia<\/a>","item_count":49782,"category":"Topic","local_url":"\/topic\/crime-courts\/","kind":"vertical","muted_by_default":false,"links":"","daily_count":130,"livevideo":"","items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=1","moderation_status":"approved","twitter_username":null,"slug":"crime-courts","related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=1","facebookchat":"","recent_count":18,"latest_item_date":"2015-01-08T14:11:42.155484","wikipedia_url":"/web/20150108141741/http://en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Crime","name":"crime & courts","permalink":"/web/20150108141741/http://www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/crime-courts\/","image_url":"/web/20150108141741/http://upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/4\/4b\/Pierre-Paul_Prud%27hon_-_Justice_and_Divine_Vengeance_Pursuing_Crime.JPG","placetype":"","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/1\/","active":true,"woeid":null}],"content":"Editor's note: AFP are reporting that the two suspects who are still at large following the Charlie Hebdo attack have been located in northern France; they are not identifying a source and do not specify where in northern France or whether this is a current operation or a previous sighting - David","url":"","type":"note","slug":"afp-are-reporting-that-the-two-suspects-who-are-st","url_domain":null,"status":"published","pushed":false,"push_content":"Editor's note: AFP are reporting that the two suspects who are still at large following the Charlie Hebdo attack have been located in northern France; they are not identifying a source and do not specify where in northern France or whether this is a current operation or a previous sighting - David","id":494335,"permalink":"/web/20150108141741/http://www.breakingnews.com\/item\/2015\/01\/08\/afp-are-reporting-that-the-two-suspects-who-are-st","data_type":null,"media":null,"tweet":null,"updated_date":"2015-01-08T10:55:58.880709","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/494335\/","data":null,"date":"2015-01-08T10:55:56.043219"},{"note":null,"author":{"full_name":"David Wyllie","email":"david.wyllie@breakingnews.com","id":12,"last_name":"Wyllie","first_name":"David","is_staff":true,"resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/user\/12\/","username":"david.wyllie"},"short_permalink":"/web/20150108141741/http://www.breakingnews.com\/i\/CEk2","shortened_url":null,"local_url":"\/item\/2015\/01\/08\/police-officer-shot-in-south-of-paris-has-died-po","submitter":"editor","whoas":44,"importance":4,"source":null,"date_ap":"Jan 08, 2015, 10:38 AM GMT","topics":[{"id":102892,"longitude":null,"description":"Gunmen  attacked the Paris office of French satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo, killing 12 people and injuring seven.","created_on":"2015-01-07T11:04:56.090160","latitude":null,"geohash":"","short_permalink":"/web/20150108141741/http://www.breakingnews.com\/t\/avi","image_credit":"via NBC News","item_count":140,"category":"WarConflictEvent","local_url":"\/topic\/shots-fired-at-french-satirical-magazine-charlie-hebdo\/","kind":"arc","muted_by_default":false,"links":"","daily_count":106,"livevideo":"","items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=102892","moderation_status":"approved","twitter_username":null,"slug":"shots-fired-at-french-satirical-magazine-charlie-hebdo","related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=102892","facebookchat":"","recent_count":12,"latest_item_date":"2015-01-08T14:11:42.155484","wikipedia_url":"","name":"Gunmen attack French magazine Charlie Hebdo","permalink":"/web/20150108141741/http://www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/shots-fired-at-french-satirical-magazine-charlie-hebdo\/","image_url":"/web/20150108141741/http://media3.s-nbcnews.com\/j\/newscms\/2015_02\/837226\/150107-paris-gunmen-mn-620_68b39086b9084be578b5c6ee123b09bc.nbcnews-fp-1040-600.jpg","placetype":"","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/102892\/","active":true,"woeid":null},{"id":244,"longitude":1.71819,"description":"<p><b>France<\/b> (<small>UK:<\/small> \/frɑːns\/; <small>US:<\/small> \/fræns\/; <small>French:<\/small> [fʁɑ̃s]<small class=\"nowrap\"> ( )<\/small>), officially the <b>French Republic<\/b> (<small>French:<\/small> République française [ʁepyblik fʁɑ̃sɛz]), is a unitary sovereign state comprising territory in Western Europe and several overseas regions and territories.

Common definitions of terrorism refer only to those violent acts that are intended to create fear (terror); are perpetrated for a religious, political, or ideological goal; and deliberately target or disregard the safety of non-combatants (e.g., neutral military personnel or civilians). Some definitions now include acts of unlawful violence and war. The use of similar tactics by criminal organizations for protection rackets or to enforce a code of silence is usually not labeled terrorism, though these same actions may be labeled terrorism when done by a politically motivated group.

Together with the Council of the European Union (the Council) and the European Commission, it exercises the legislative function of the EU. The Parliament is composed of 751 (previously 766) members, who represent the second largest democratic electorate in the world (after the Parliament of India) and the largest trans-national democratic electorate in the world (375 million eligible voters in 2009).<\/p>\n<p>It has been directly elected every five years by universal suffrage since 1979. However, turnout at European Parliament elections has fallen consecutively at each election since that date, and has been under 50% since 1999. Turnout in 2014 stood at 42.54% of all European voters.<\/p>\n<p>Although the European Parliament has legislative power that the Council and Commission do not possess, it does not formally possess legislative initiative, as most national parliaments of European Union member states do. The Parliament is the \"first institution\" of the EU (mentioned first in the treaties, having ceremonial precedence over all authority at European level), and shares equal legislative and budgetary powers with the Council (except in a few areas where the special legislative procedures apply). It likewise has equal control over the EU budget. Finally, the European Commission, the executive body of the EU, is accountable to Parliament. In particular, Parliament elects the President of the Commission, and approves (or rejects) the appointment of the Commission as a whole. It can subsequently force the Commission as a body to resign by adopting a motion of censure.<\/p>\n<p>The President of the European Parliament (Parliament's speaker) is Martin Schulz (S&amp;D), elected in January 2012. He presides over a multi-party chamber, the two largest groups being the Group of the European People's Party (EPP) and the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats (S&amp;D). The last union-wide elections were the 2014 elections. The European Parliament has three places of work – Brussels (Belgium), the city of Luxembourg and Strasbourg (France). Luxembourg is home to the administrative offices (the 'General Secretariat'). Meetings of the whole Parliament ('plenary sessions') take place in Strasbourg and in Brussels. Committee meetings are held in Brussels.<\/p>\n<p><\/p>","created_on":"2013-10-09T10:20:16.316284","latitude":null,"geohash":"","short_permalink":"/web/20150108141741/http://www.breakingnews.com\/t\/MIt","image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"/web/20150108141741/http://en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/European_Parliament\">Wikipedia<\/a>","item_count":41,"category":"Organization","local_url":"\/topic\/european-parliament\/","kind":"tag","muted_by_default":false,"links":"","daily_count":1,"livevideo":"","items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=46669","moderation_status":"approved","twitter_username":null,"slug":"european-parliament","related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=46669","facebookchat":"","recent_count":0,"latest_item_date":"2015-01-08T10:24:58.530820","wikipedia_url":"/web/20150108141741/http://en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/European_Parliament","name":"European Parliament","permalink":"/web/20150108141741/http://www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/european-parliament\/","image_url":"/web/20150108141741/http://upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/9\/91\/Europarl_logo.svg","placetype":"","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/46669\/","active":true,"woeid":null},{"id":710,"longitude":null,"description":"<p>In the international community, <b>terrorism<\/b> has no legally binding, criminal law definition.

The term crime does not, in modern criminal law, have any simple and universally accepted definition, though statutory definitions have been provided for certain purposes. The most popular view is that crime is a category created by law (i.e. something is a crime if applicable law says that it is). One proposed definition is that a <b>crime<\/b>, also called an <b>offence<\/b> or a <b>criminal offence<\/b>, is an act harmful not only to some individual, but also to the community or the state (a public wrong). Such acts are forbidden and punishable by law.<\/p>\r\n<p>The idea that acts like murder, rape and theft are prohibited exists all around the world. What precisely is a criminal offence is defined by criminal law of each country. While many have a catalogue of crimes called the criminal code, in some common law countries no such comprehensive statute exists.<\/p>\r\n<p>The state (government) has the power to severely restrict one's liberty for committing a crime. Therefore, in modern societies, a criminal procedure must be adhered to during the investigation and trial. Only if found guilty, the offender may be sentenced to punishment such as community sentence, imprisonment, life imprisonment or, in some jurisdictions, even death.<\/p>\r\n<p>To be classified as a crime, the act of doing something bad (actus reus) must be usually accompanied by the intention to do something bad (mens rea), with certain exceptions (strict liability).<\/p>\r\n<p>While every crime violates the law, not every violation of the law counts as a crime.

It is generally characterised by extreme violence, social disruption and economic destruction. War should be understood as an actual, intentional and widespread armed conflict between political communities, and therefore is defined as a form of (collective) political violence or intervention. The set of techniques used by a group to carry out war is known as <b>warfare<\/b>. An absence of war is usually called peace.<\/p>\n<p>While some scholars see warfare as an inescapable and integral aspect of human nature, others argue that it is only inevitable under certain socio-cultural or ecological circumstances. For some the practice of war is not linked to any single type of political organization or society. Rather, as discussed by John Keegan in his <i>A History of Warfare<\/i>, war is a universal phenomenon whose form and scope is defined by the society that wages it. Another argument suggests that since there are human societies in which warfare does not exist, humans may not be naturally disposed for warfare, which emerges under particular circumstances.<\/p>\n<p>The deadliest war in history, in terms of the cumulative number of deaths since its start, is the Second World War, with 60–85 million deaths, followed by the Mongol conquests. Proportionally speaking, the most destructive war in modern history is the War of the Triple Alliance, which took the lives of over 60% of Paraguay's population, according to Steven Pinker. In 2003, Richard Smalley identified war as the sixth (of ten) biggest problems facing humanity for the next fifty years.<\/p>\n<p><\/p>","created_on":"2012-11-28T17:18:48","latitude":null,"geohash":"","short_permalink":"/web/20150108141741/http://www.breakingnews.com\/t\/P","image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"/web/20150108141741/http://en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/War\">Wikipedia<\/a>","item_count":27735,"category":"Topic","local_url":"\/topic\/war-conflict\/","kind":"vertical","muted_by_default":false,"links":"","daily_count":60,"livevideo":"","items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=15","moderation_status":"approved","twitter_username":null,"slug":"war-conflict","related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=15","facebookchat":"","recent_count":12,"latest_item_date":"2015-01-08T14:11:42.155484","wikipedia_url":"/web/20150108141741/http://en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/War","name":"war & conflict","permalink":"/web/20150108141741/http://www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/war-conflict\/","image_url":"/web/20150108141741/http://upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/a\/a7\/Cyprian_War.jpg","placetype":"","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/15\/","active":true,"woeid":null}],"content":"Photo: Police tactical vehicle deployed at shooting site in Malakoff, Paris -

Metropolitan France extends from the Mediterranean Sea to the English Channel and the North Sea, and from the Rhine to the Atlantic Ocean; due to its shape, it is often referred to in French as <i>l’Hexagone<\/i> (\"The Hexagon\"). France is one of only three countries (with Morocco and Spain) to have both Atlantic and Mediterranean coastlines.<\/p>\n<p>By area, France is the 42nd largest country in the world but the largest country in Western Europe and the European Union (EU), and the third-largest in Europe as a whole. With a population approaching 67 million, it is the 20th most populated country and the second-most populated country in the EU. France is a semi-presidential republic with its capital in Paris, the nation's largest city and the main cultural and commercial center. The current Constitution of France, adopted by referendum on 4 October 1958, establishes the country as secular and democratic, with its sovereignty derived from the people. The nation's ideals are expressed in the <i>Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen<\/i>, one of the world's earliest documents on human rights, which was formulated during the seminal French Revolution of the late 18th century.<\/p>\n<p>France has been a major power in Europe since the Late Middle Ages, reaching the height of global prominence during the 19th and early 20th centuries, when it possessed the second-largest colonial empire in the world. Throughout its long history, France has produced many influential artists, thinkers, and scientists, and remains a prominent global center of culture. It hosts the world's fourth-largest number of cultural UNESCO World Heritage Sites and receives around 83 million foreign tourists annually – the most of any country in the world.<\/p>\n<p>France remains a great power with significant cultural, economic, military, and political influence in Europe and around the world. It has the world's fifth-largest military budget, third-largest stockpile of nuclear weapons, and second-largest diplomatic corps. Due to its overseas regions and territories throughout the world, France has the second-largest exclusive economic zone in the world. France is a developed country and has the world's fifth-largest economy by nominal GDP and seventh-largest by purchasing power parity. In terms of total household wealth, France is the wealthiest nation in Europe and fourth in the world.<\/p>\n<p>French citizens enjoy a high standard of living, and the country performs well in international rankings of education, health care, life expectancy, civil liberties, and human development. France is a founding member of the United Nations, where it serves as one of the five permanent members of the UN Security Council. It is a member of numerous international institutions, including the Group of 7, North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), the World Trade Organization (WTO), and La Francophonie. France is a founding and leading member state of the EU.<\/p>\n<p><\/p>\n","created_on":"2011-05-16T22:37:58","latitude":46.7107,"geohash":"u031xp7js9x6","short_permalink":"/web/20150108141741/http://www.breakingnews.com\/t\/D6","image_credit":"<a href=\"/web/20150108141741/http://en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/France\">Wikipedia<\/a>","item_count":2634,"category":"Country","local_url":"\/topic\/france\/","kind":"location","muted_by_default":false,"links":"","daily_count":43,"livevideo":"","items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=244","moderation_status":"approved","twitter_username":null,"slug":"france","related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=244","facebookchat":"","recent_count":2,"latest_item_date":"2015-01-08T12:28:40.359567","wikipedia_url":"/web/20150108141741/http://en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/France","name":"France","permalink":"/web/20150108141741/http://www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/france\/","image_url":"/web/20150108141741/http://upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/en\/c\/c3\/Flag_of_France.svg","placetype":"Country","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/244\/","active":true,"woeid":23424819},{"id":515,"longitude":2.3412,"description":"","created_on":"2011-04-22T01:31:35","latitude":48.8569,"geohash":"u09tvq0u44k8","short_permalink":"/web/20150108141741/http://www.breakingnews.com\/t\/IT","image_credit":"","item_count":541,"category":"Town","local_url":"\/topic\/paris-ile-de-france-fr\/","kind":"location","muted_by_default":false,"links":"","daily_count":89,"livevideo":"","items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=515","moderation_status":"approved","twitter_username":null,"slug":"paris-ile-de-france-fr","related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=515","facebookchat":"","recent_count":13,"latest_item_date":"2015-01-08T14:11:42.155484","wikipedia_url":"","name":"Paris, Ile-de-France, FR","permalink":"/web/20150108141741/http://www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/paris-ile-de-france-fr\/","image_url":"","placetype":"Town","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/515\/","active":true,"woeid":615702},{"id":710,"longitude":null,"description":"<p>In the international community, <b>terrorism<\/b> has no legally binding, criminal law definition.

Italian: <i>Francesco<\/i>; born <b>Jorge Mario Bergoglio<\/b>, 17 December 1936) is pope of the Catholic Church, in which capacity he is Bishop of Rome and absolute Sovereign of the Vatican City State.<\/p>\n<p>Born in Buenos Aires, Argentina, Bergoglio worked briefly as a chemical technician and nightclub bouncer before beginning seminary studies. He was ordained a Catholic priest in 1969, and from 1973 to 1979 was Argentina's Provincial Superior of the Society of Jesus. He became the Archbishop of Buenos Aires in 1998, and was created a cardinal in 2001 by Pope John Paul II.<\/p>\n<p>Following the resignation of Pope Benedict XVI on 28 February 2013, a papal conclave elected Bergoglio as his successor on 13 March. He chose Francis as his papal name in honor of Saint Francis of Assisi. Francis is the first Jesuit pope, the first from the Americas, the first from the Southern Hemisphere and the first non-European pope since the Syrian Gregory III in 741, 1,272 years earlier.<\/p>\n<p>Throughout his public life, both as an individual and as a religious leader, Pope Francis has been noted for his humility, his concern for the poor, and his commitment to dialogue as a way to build bridges between people of all backgrounds, beliefs, and faiths. He is known for having a simpler and less formal approach to the papacy, most notably by choosing to reside in the Domus Sanctae Marthae guesthouse rather than the papal apartments of the Apostolic Palace used by his predecessors. In addition, due to both his Jesuit and Ignatian aesthetic, he is known for favoring simpler vestments void of ornamentation, by starting to refuse the traditional papal mozzetta cape upon his election, choosing silver instead of gold for his piscatory ring, and keeping the same pectoral cross he had when he was cardinal.<\/p>\n<p>The Pontiff has affirmed Catholic doctrine on abortion, artificial contraception, and homosexuality. Whilst maintaining the Church's teaching against homosexual acts, he has said that gay people should not be marginalized. As a cardinal, he opposed same-sex marriage in Argentina. In addition, he maintains that he is a \"son of the Church\" regarding loyalty to Church doctrine, and has spoken against abortion as \"horrific\", suggested that women be valued, not clericalized. Summarily, Pope Francis reiterates that \"It is absurd to say you follow Jesus Christ, but reject the Church.\"<\/p>\n<p>Accordingly, he urged Bishop Charles J. Scicluna of Malta to speak out against adoption by same-sex couples, maintained that divorced and re-married Catholics may not receive the Eucharist, and excommunicated a former Catholic priest for Eucharistic sacrilege and heretical views. Furthermore, he emphasized the Christian obligation to assist the poor and the needy in an optimistic tone, as well as promoting peace negotiations and interfaith dialogue. Pope Francis has also announced a zero-tolerance policy towards sex abuse in the Church, saying that sex abuse was \"as bad as performing a satanic mass.\"<\/p>\n<p><\/p>\n","created_on":"2013-03-13T19:36:04","latitude":null,"geohash":"","short_permalink":"/web/20150108141741/http://www.breakingnews.com\/t\/IJ","image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"/web/20150108141741/http://en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Pope_Francis\">Wikipedia<\/a>","item_count":326,"category":"Person","local_url":"\/topic\/francis-i\/","kind":"tag","muted_by_default":false,"links":"","daily_count":2,"livevideo":"","items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=505","moderation_status":"approved","twitter_username":null,"slug":"francis-i","related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=505","facebookchat":"","recent_count":0,"latest_item_date":"2015-01-08T10:11:23.577622","wikipedia_url":"/web/20150108141741/http://en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Pope_Francis","name":"Francis I","permalink":"/web/20150108141741/http://www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/francis-i\/","image_url":"/web/20150108141741/http://upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/0\/09\/Pope_Francis_Korea_Haemi_Castle_19_%28cropped%29.jpg","placetype":"","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/505\/","active":true,"woeid":null},{"id":710,"longitude":null,"description":"<p>In the international community, <b>terrorism<\/b> has no legally binding, criminal law definition. Common definitions of terrorism refer only to those violent acts that are intended to create fear (terror); are perpetrated for a religious, political, or ideological goal; and deliberately target or disregard the safety of non-combatants (e.g., neutral military personnel or civilians). Some definitions now include acts of unlawful violence and war. The use of similar tactics by criminal organizations for protection rackets or to enforce a code of silence is usually not labeled terrorism, though these same actions may be labeled terrorism when done by a politically motivated group. Usage of the term has also been criticized for its frequent undue equating with <i>Islamism<\/i> or <i>jihadism<\/i>, while ignoring non-Islamic organizations or individuals.<\/p>\r\n<p>The word \"terrorism\" is politically loaded and emotionally charged, and this greatly compounds the difficulty of providing a precise definition. Studies have found over 100 definitions of \"terrorism\". In some cases, the same group may be described as \"freedom fighters\" by its supporters and considered to be terrorists by its opponents. The concept of terrorism may be controversial as it is often used by state authorities (and individuals with access to state support) to delegitimize political or other opponents, and potentially legitimize the state's own use of armed force against opponents (such use of force may be described as \"terror\" by opponents of the state). At the same time, the reverse may also take place when states perpetrate or are accused of perpetrating state terrorism. The usage of the term has a controversial history, with individuals such as ANC leader Nelson Mandela at one point also branded a terrorist.<\/p>\r\n<p>Terrorism has been practiced by a broad array of political organizations to further their objectives.
