## Description

The trial data contains the full English Twitter and Reddit training/dev set.

In both Twitter and Reddit cases, the original post and each comment post are provided separately, with a key indicating the tree structure of the comment. Reddit JSON has a nested format, but comments have been separated out to mimic the structure of the Twitter data as closely as possible. The original raw JSON is also provided.

You can use the scorer over the development data to validate your system. Final submissions are to be made on the CodaLab site.

## Source data

The bulk of the dataset used for training and development testing is from this PLoS article:

Zubiaga A, Liakata M, Procter R, Wong Sak Hoi G, Tolmie P (2016) Analysing How People Orient to and Spread Rumours in Social Media by Looking at Conversational Threads. PLoS ONE 11(3): e0150989. doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0150989
